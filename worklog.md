# MIRAGE — Build Worklog

Project: Immersive, motion-driven, mobile-first UAE vape brand website (frontend-only, mock data).
Spec: /home/z/my-project/upload/Pasted Content_1792438065702.txt

---
Task ID: 1-5 (foundation)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Build the complete foundation: design tokens, root layout, types, mock data, mock services, smoke engine, motion system, layout components, shared UI, admin primitives, form components.

Work Log:
- Read the full 1393-line spec from the uploaded file.
- Confirmed Caddy gateway proxies ALL paths to :3000 (multi-route IA will work in preview).
- Wrote design tokens in src/app/globals.css: near-black violet-tinted palette (bg-0..bg-3, violet/ice/magenta accents, warm-white text), fluid clamp() type scale (text-hero/display/h1/h2/h3/lead/label/legal/meta), glass utilities, smoke keyframes (smoke-drift-a/b/c, breathe, ring-rotate, shimmer), reduced-motion kill switch, print styles for legal docs.
- Rewrote src/app/layout.tsx: Space Grotesk (display) + Inter (body) + Geist Mono via next/font, brand metadata template, dark theme, skip-link, Toaster.
- Wrote src/types/index.ts: SiteSettings, NavigationItem, ContentPage/Section, CatalogItem/Category, ItemVariant, MediaAsset, UserProfile, AccountPreferences, SavedItem, OrderSummary/Detail, SupportTicket, LegalDocument, ComplianceRecord, AdminRole, AuditEvent, AdminCustomer, Paginated, Loadable.
- Wrote mock data (src/data/): site-settings, navigation (header/mobile/footer/legal), catalog (5 categories, 12 products with full specs/variants/conformity/warnings/FAQs), orders (4 summaries + 2 details), tickets (5), content pages (7), legal docs (4), compliance records (7), media assets (10), account mocks (user, prefs, sessions).
- Wrote mock services (src/services/): content, catalog, account, saved-items (zustand in-memory store), orders, support, media, admin — all with simulated latency, explicit "MOCK ADAPTER" headers, contract-shaped for future D1/R2.
- Wrote motion system (src/lib/motion.ts): variants (fade/fadeUp/slide/scale/imageReveal/modal/drawer), transitions, stagger, press/hover helpers, revealViewport.
- Wrote atmosphere presets (src/lib/atmosphere.ts): ambient/cinematic/reduced configs + resolvePreset (reduced-motion, deviceMemory, saveData aware).
- Smoke engine (src/components/atmosphere/): motion-boundary (IntersectionObserver + preset context), smoke-layer (CSS-only GPU blobs, pause off-screen), ambient-smoke (orchestrator with pointer parallax via motion values — zero re-renders), atmospheric-particles (canvas, DPR-aware, pauses off-screen/hidden tab), ambient-lighting, hero-visual (rings + vapor orb + orbiting mote + parallax), section-atmosphere, gradient-backdrop, glow-surface (pointer-tracked hover glow), reveal-section.
- Layout (src/components/layout/): logo (SVG monogram), site-header (scroll-solidifying, quick search, saved/account entries, mobile trigger), desktop-navigation, mobile-navigation (Radix Dialog + Motion full-height sheet with focus management), bottom-navigation (5 configurable destinations, active indicator, safe-area), site-footer (columns, legal strip, age notice), breadcrumbs, page-heading, page-container/section-container, app-shell (min-h-screen flex, sticky footer, fixed ambient backdrop).
- Shared UI (src/components/shared/): empty-state, error-state, loading-indicator + CardGridSkeleton, prototype-notice, status-badge (order/availability/ticket/content/compliance variants — icon+text, never color-only), item-card (image fail state, saved control via mock store, keyboard), category-card, content-card + document-card (honest disabled when href missing), item-gallery (Radix zoom dialog + thumbnails + fail states), specification-list, information-accordion (Radix), item-grid (stagger + empty state), admin-shell (collapsible sidebar, mobile drawer, topbar, breadcrumbs), admin-primitives (SearchField, FilterBar, StatCard, DataTable with sort + mobile cards, Pagination, FormSection, AuditLogList).
- Forms (src/components/forms/fields.tsx): FormField, TextInput, TextArea, Select, PasswordInput (visibility toggle), Checkbox, RadioGroup, FormError, FormSuccess — all accessible, brand-styled.
- Fixed 2 lint errors (missing motion import; setState-in-effect → derived-state-during-render pattern). Lint now clean.

Stage Summary:
- Foundation complete and lint-clean. Brand = MIRAGE (UAE), permanent dark theme, Space Grotesk/Inter.
- All page-building agents MUST reuse these components — do not re-implement.
- Image paths expected: /products/{slug}.jpg (+ -2 variants), /brand/atelier.jpg, /brand/craft.jpg, /og-image.jpg.
- Product slugs: aura-700, dune-pro-2500, halo-pod-kit, eclipse-pod-kit, nebula-freebase-30, sirocco-salt-30, zephyr-shortfill-60, obsidian-80w-kit, cirrus-aio, mesh-coil-5pack, drip-tip-set, type-c-cable.

Task ID: 6-a
Agent: homepage-builder
Task: Build the homepage — server page with metadata plus 7 section components (hero, brand intro, discover, collection preview, company, safety band, support).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + foundation sources (motion.ts, page-container, hero-visual, reveal-section, section-atmosphere, content-card, item-grid, item-card, prototype-notice, glow-surface, app-shell, site-settings, catalog, globals.css) to reuse tokens/components exactly.
- Wrote src/components/homepage/hero-section.tsx: min-h-[92svh] relative overflow-hidden section, HeroVisual preset="cinematic" behind (content z-10), light vertical legibility scrim between visual and copy, eyebrow pill "UAE · EST. 2021 · ADULTS 18+", h1 text-hero font-display font-bold ("Crafted vapor." + .text-gradient "Elevated atmosphere."), max-w-md text-lead intro, CTA pair (primary /discover "Enter the collection" rounded-full bg-primary px-7 py-3.5; ghost /brand "Our craft"), micro-labels row (text-meta uppercase tracking-widest), framer-motion staggerContainer/staggerItem entrance (gated by useReducedMotion), scroll indicator absolute bottom-8 left-1/2 → anchor to #the-brand with ChevronDown + sr-only text, bounce via motion (disabled under reduced motion).
- Wrote brand-intro-section.tsx: full-width hairline + centered rotated-diamond mark at section top (hero→brand transition), SectionAtmosphere variant="ice" intensity={0.5} behind, lg 2-col: RevealSection copy (eyebrow "The brand", text-h2 "An atmosphere, not a storefront", 2 original craft/testing paragraphs, "Read the full story →" → /brand) + RevealSection variant="imageReveal" with next/image /brand/craft.jpg in aspect-[4/3] rounded-3xl gradient-frame wrapper and onError fallback ("Craft photography — coming soon" + diamond) so a 404 image still looks intentional.
- Wrote discover-section.tsx: HOME_DISCOVER_ITEMS const array (title/body/href/icon: Compass, Sparkles, ShieldAlert, FileCheck2, LifeBuoy, Mail) → heading row (text-h2 "Discover" + "View all →") + 2/3-col ContentCard grid.
- Wrote collection-preview.tsx: eyebrow "The collection", h2 "Selected pieces", CATALOG_ITEMS.filter(featured).slice(0,8) through shared ItemGrid columns={4}.
- Wrote company-section.tsx: staggered stat grid (2021 / 5 / 100% / 2 — font-display text-4xl text-gradient-violet), right column company copy (Mirage Vapor Trading L.L.C., Dubai), credentials list with Check icons (Trade licence · Dubai DED "Details on request", batch testing docs, TPD-style identifiers), per-client-approval note + PrototypeNotice ("sample data pending client verification").
- Wrote safety-section.tsx: full-width muted band (border-y, bg-abyss/50, no smoke overlay), glass card (rounded-3xl border border-line bg-elevated/50 p-8 sm:p-10), ShieldAlert tile, h2 "Restricted by design", text-legal copy (nicotine addictive-chemical warning, 18+ UAE restriction, purchasing not enabled), 3 pill links (Safety, Compliance, Consumer information).
- Wrote support-section.tsx: h2 "Need a hand?" + intro, 3 ContentCards (Help centre, FAQs, Contact) + contact micro-row with Mail/Phone links built from SITE_SETTINGS (supportEmail, phone).
- Wrote src/app/(site)/page.tsx (server): export const metadata title "Premium vapor, crafted in the UAE" + description from SITE_SETTINGS; composes Hero → BrandIntro → Discover → CollectionPreview → Company → Safety → Support. No shell chrome (comes from (site)/layout AppShell).
- A11y: exactly one h1 (hero); every section is a named landmark via aria-labelledby → h2 id; all icons aria-hidden; arrows in links as aria-hidden spans; reduced-motion gated everywhere.
- BLOCKER FIXED (one-line deviation from "foundation files untouched", required to unblock /): src/components/shared/item-card.tsx imported pressTap from "framer-motion" — not a framer-motion export — which 500'd every page rendering ItemGrid/ItemCard (incl. homepage). Changed to import pressTap from "@/lib/motion" (its actual home per the motion system). Diff: line 6-7 only. Please review/keep.
- Verified: curl / → 200; all 7 sections present in SSR HTML; single <h1>; 7 aria-labelledby pairs; title renders "Premium vapor, crafted in the UAE — MIRAGE"; dev.log clean for homepage chain (only pre-existing metadataBase warning from root layout).

Stage Summary:
- Homepage complete: 7 sections live on /, composed server-side with metadata; hero is cinematic with HeroVisual behind gradient headline; brand story has hairline-diamond transition + ice atmosphere + fail-safe image slot; discover grid is data-driven (HOME_DISCOVER_ITEMS); collection preview shows 4 featured items via ItemGrid; company/safety/support close the page with trust + compliance + help.
- Lint: my files (page.tsx + 7 homepage components + touched item-card) clean. Remaining repo lint errors are react-hooks/set-state-in-effect in src/app/admin/* (other agents' scope) — untouched.
- Note for other agents: /brand/craft.jpg and /products/*.jpg do not exist yet — homepage degrades gracefully (gradient placeholder with onError fallback on brand image; ItemCard has its own fail state).

Task ID: 6-b
Agent: catalog-builder
Task: Build the catalog pages: /discover, /categories, /categories/[slug], /products/[slug], /search, /saved — reusing foundation components, services and mock data only.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + all relevant foundation modules (data/catalog, services/catalog, services/saved-items, shared components, admin-primitives, forms/fields, layout components, globals tokens) before writing anything; no foundation file was modified.
- /discover: server page (metadata "Discover") + client discover-view. PageHeading, category chip row (All + 5 categories, aria-pressed, no-scrollbar horizontal scroll on mobile), search entry form (router.push to /search?q=), sort Select (Featured / Name A–Z / Z–A / Newest), availability FilterBar chips, catalogService.items({categorySlug, sort, availability, page, pageSize:9}) keyed-fetch pattern (request-key comparison instead of setState-in-effect, keeping react-hooks/set-state-in-effect clean). States: CardGridSkeleton(8) / ErrorState+retry / EmptyState(PackageSearch, "Clear filters" action). Numbered Pagination + "Showing X of Y" aria-live. Collections intro row of CategoryCards only on the All view. Added loading.tsx with skeleton header + CardGridSkeleton.
- /categories: server page, metadata "Categories", PageHeading + grid (1 / sm:2 / lg:3) of CategoryCard for all CATALOG_CATEGORIES, wrapped in relative host with SectionAtmosphere variant="violet" intensity={0.5} and z-10 content.
- /categories/[slug]: generateStaticParams from CATALOG_CATEGORIES; generateMetadata awaits params (name/description); unknown slug → notFound() (verified 404). Breadcrumbs Home/Categories/Name, text-h1 title, longDescription. Client island sort-control.tsx sorts an in-memory copy (Featured / A–Z / Z–A) and renders ItemGrid columns=3 with category-tailored empty state. "Back to categories" link row.
- /products/[slug]: generateStaticParams over all 12 items; generateMetadata name+tagline; notFound() verified for unknown slug. Breadcrumbs Home/Categories/{category}/{name}; lg:grid-cols-2 gap-10 — ItemGallery left; right column: brand eyebrow, text-h1 name, lead tagline, font-mono SKU/model row, AvailabilityBadge + nicotine chip + "18+ · Adults only" warning chip, prominent safety box (border-warning/30 bg-warning/[0.06], text-legal) high in column, VariantPicker, single disabled purchase button "Purchasing coming soon — pending compliance review" (opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed) + compact PrototypeNotice. No price/cart anywhere.
- variant-picker.tsx (client): groups variants by type (flavor/color/capacity chip buttons with swatch dots, aria-pressed, border-violet-glow selected; unavailable → disabled + line-through + tooltip title; RadioGroup from forms/fields for nicotine). Purely informational state; defaults to first available per group; graceful "no variants" note.
- InformationAccordion section id="product-details" (scroll-mt for anchor): Description, Specifications (SpecificationList), Compatibility (list or "Not applicable for this record."), Manufacturer (MIRAGE — designed and documented in Dubai + origin when present), Safety information, Compliance & documents (conformity rows with StatusBadge tone map verified=success / pending=warning / missing=neutral + DocumentCard list), FAQs when present.
- Related: resolves relatedSlugs via catalogItemBySlug (skips missing), "Related information & items" + ItemGrid columns=4.
- mobile-summary.tsx (client, lg:hidden): glass-strong fixed bar bottom-16 md:bottom-0 z-40 with truncated name + AvailabilityBadge + "Details" anchor to #product-details; page wrapper carries pb-28 md:pb-16 lg:pb-0 so nothing is obscured.
- /search: server page wraps SearchView in Suspense with CardGridSkeleton fallback (verified SSR shell renders fallback + correct metadata; view hydrates client-side per Next useSearchParams pattern). search-view.tsx: h-14 text-lg autoFocus input (Search icon, clear button, aria-label), Enter submits, Escape clears (refocuses input), URL synced via router.replace q param (debounced 250ms). Debounced suggest(q) shown as suggestion quick-links (/products/{slug}, category label) while typing; full results catalogService.items({query, pageSize:12}) once submitted or debounced. States: idle prompt with popular-category chips, LoadingIndicator while searching, count text aria-live, ItemGrid columns=4, EmptyState "No matches for “q”" with clear action, ErrorState with retry (retry tick in request key).
- /saved: server page (metadata "Saved") + client saved-view: brief LoadingIndicator via savedItemsService.list(), useSavedItems store resolved against CATALOG_ITEMS by id, PrototypeNotice "Saved items live in memory for this session…", empty state (Bookmark, "Nothing saved yet", action → /discover, secondary link → /account/sign-in), grid of ItemCards each with a Remove button calling savedItemsService.remove + useToast confirmation toast.
- Global: no horizontal overflow (chip rows scroll internally with no-scrollbar; controls flex-wrap; grids grid-cols-2 base gap-4), icons aria-hidden, accessible names on all controls, loading/error/empty states on every data load, relative links only, no new dependencies.
- Verification: bunx eslint on my five route dirs → clean (remaining repo lint errors are in other agents' account/admin files). All six routes return 200 on the dev server with no compile errors in dev.log; bogus category/product slugs return 404; SSR content spot-checked (safety box, disabled purchase, variants, category items, saved empty state).

Stage Summary:
- Catalog route group complete: /discover, /categories, /categories/[slug], /products/[slug], /search, /saved all live and lint-clean, built exclusively on the foundation component/service/data layer.
- Search uses the Suspense + useSearchParams shell pattern (fallback in SSR HTML, content after hydration) as specified; product pages are fully static (generateStaticParams) with honest 404s.
- Files added (all under src/app/(site)/): discover/page.tsx, discover/discover-view.tsx, discover/loading.tsx, categories/page.tsx, categories/[slug]/page.tsx, categories/[slug]/sort-control.tsx, products/[slug]/page.tsx, products/[slug]/variant-picker.tsx, products/[slug]/mobile-summary.tsx, search/page.tsx, search/search-view.tsx, saved/page.tsx, saved/saved-view.tsx.

Task ID: 6-d
Agent: content-builder
Task: Build COMPANY, HELP and LEGAL pages: /about, /brand, /help, /help/faq, /contact, /safety, /compliance and /legal/{terms,privacy,cookies,consumer-information} plus the shared legal document template.

Work Log:
- Reused foundation only: PageHeading/PageContainer/SectionContainer, Breadcrumbs, RevealSection, SectionAtmosphere, InformationAccordion, ContentCard/DocumentCard, StatusBadge/ComplianceStatusBadge, PrototypeNotice, EmptyState, SearchField (admin-primitives), form fields, Button, useToast, SITE_SETTINGS/LEGAL_DOCUMENTS/COMPLIANCE_RECORDS. No foundation files touched.
- /about: PageHeading, who-we-are prose (brandLegalName), stats band (2021/5/100%/2-day), "What we publish" credentials list with FileCheck2 + "On request" StatusBadges, vertical timeline 2021-2022-2023-2025, PrototypeNotice, violet SectionAtmosphere behind the header.
- /brand: editorial display header "The haze, considered", two next/image bands (/brand/atelier.jpg, /brand/craft.jpg) wrapped in aspect-[16/9] gradient-placeholder figures with glass captions (assets 404-safe), 4 value cards, 6-step numbered process (brief → documentation), pull-quote, CTA to /discover. No health claims.
- /help: search link-card to /search, 6 ContentCard topics, escalation card (support email from settings + complaints note → /legal/consumer-information), 3-question FAQ preview via InformationAccordion (HELP_FAQS inline).
- /help/faq: typed FAQS const in faqs.ts (19 Q&As across Devices/Liquids/Safety/Orders/Account/Privacy); client faq-view.tsx with SearchField + category chips (mobile) + sticky sidebar topic nav with counts (lg), scroll-mt-28 anchor article per question, empty/no-matches EmptyState with clear action.
- /contact: two-column — details card (email/support/phone/address/hours/social from SITE_SETTINGS) + complaints escalation card (support → compliance office, response times); client contact-form.tsx with zod validation (name/email/subject Select/message ≥20 chars/required privacy consent checkbox → /legal/privacy), simulated delay, honest FormSuccess ("message was NOT sent — no backend"), FormError path, toast.
- /safety: warning banner (border-warning/30 bg-warning/[0.06], "Nicotine is an addictive chemical." + ageRestrictionNotice), "Read first" DocumentCards → /legal/consumer-information + /compliance, InformationAccordion (storage, battery, disposal, reporting incl. batch code/model/description, travel).
- /compliance: PrototypeNotice ("does not itself establish compliance"), age restrictions card (18+, verification at purchase & delivery, no-purchase prototype note), health warnings card, conformity register — all 7 COMPLIANCE_RECORDS with ComplianceStatusBadge + font-mono lastReviewed/expiresAt/owner + DocumentCards ("Available on request", honest disabled when no href), business credentials ("Available on request"), PDPL + ESMA disclosure cards (marked sample), document availability card with "Last reviewed: 12 January 2025 — sample date".
- /legal/*: shared client template src/components/legal/legal-document-template.tsx (breadcrumbs Home/Legal/title, h1, font-mono meta chips, summary lead, print button + note, sticky TOC on lg with IntersectionObserver scroll-spy, mobile details-TOC, article sections with scroll-mt-24 anchors, text-legal body, print-plain on cards, PrototypeNotice + cross-links to the other 3 docs). Four tiny server pages with metadata + notFound() on unknown slug.
- Verification: all 11 routes 200 on dev server; scoped ESLint clean (project-wide lint has 8 pre-existing react-hooks/set-state-in-effect errors in account/* and admin/* view files owned by other agents — left untouched); dev.log shows no compile errors in 6-d files.

Stage Summary:
- 6-d complete: 15 files written (about, brand, help, help/faq x3, contact x2, safety, compliance, legal x4 + components/legal/legal-document-template.tsx). All honest-prototype markers, relative links, semantic headings (one h1/page), a11y labelling in place.
- NOTE for orchestrator: `border-line` / `border-line-strong` utilities do NOT compile — globals.css @theme defines --color-border: var(--line) but no --color-line/--color-line-strong theme tokens (verified by compiling a probe through the project's Tailwind 4). Foundation-wide visual impact (all cards/borders). Fix = add `--color-line: var(--line); --color-line-strong: var(--line-strong);` inside @theme inline in globals.css. Pages use border-line per spec and will pick it up automatically.
- /brand expects /brand/atelier.jpg + /brand/craft.jpg (graceful gradient placeholder while missing); /help links to /search (other agent's route).

Task ID: 6-f
Agent: admin-builder-2
Task: Build admin pages part 2 — customers (+detail), orders (+detail), support (+ticket thread), compliance, legal-documents, theme (live preview), settings, users, roles, audit-log (detail dialog).

Work Log:
- Read worklog + foundation: adminService, admin-primitives (SearchField/FilterBar/StatCard/DataTable/Pagination/FormSection), status-badge variants, forms fields, ui primitives (dialog, alert-dialog, switch, slider, tooltip), SITE_SETTINGS, LEGAL_DOCUMENTS, ATMOSPHERE_PRESETS.
- /admin/customers: SearchField + status FilterBar + DataTable (Name link, Email, StatusBadge, Joined, Orders, privacy-request badge access=warning/deletion=error, Tickets), mobileCard, pagination (6/page), debounced mock query, loading skeleton / EmptyState / ErrorState with retry.
- /admin/customers/[id]: server page awaits params, adminService.customer(id), not-found card + back link; profile card, privacy card with "Mark as processed" disabled (Tooltip "Request pipeline arrives with the backend"), orders mini-list (deterministic mock attribution by ordersCount + explicit mock note), tickets mini-list (requester-initials match), danger zone Suspend via AlertDialog → toast "Prototype — nothing was suspended".
- /admin/orders: sample-records banner, full status FilterBar (7 statuses), DataTable Reference link / Placed / Items (count + preview string) / OrderStatusBadge / Total, mobileCard, loading/empty/error.
- /admin/orders/[reference]: ORDER_DETAILS[ref] when available (vertical timeline completed/pending, items with image fallback initials, status-history table, delivery/payment/total, documents, "View public-facing page" → /account/orders/{ref}, support link); else "Full record not available in this prototype" summary card. Unknown ref → not-found card.
- /admin/support: SearchField + status + priority FilterBars, DataTable (Reference, Subject, Requester, Category, priority/status badges, Updated), mobileCard, client-side filtering, loading/empty/error.
- /admin/support/[id]: find by id OR reference; chat-style thread (customer left / agent right violet / system centered), internal-notes panel (amber border, "Internal — never shown to customer", add-note appends locally), reply composer → toast "Prototype — replies are not transmitted", status/priority Selects → local badge + simulated toast; unknown → not-found card.
- /admin/compliance: 4 StatCards (Verified/Pending/Missing/Expired), DataTable inventory (Area/Title/Description/ComplianceStatusBadge/Last reviewed/Expires/Owner/documents count) + mobileCard, "Outstanding tasks" panel with derived actions ("Chase Battery transport declaration (UN 38.3) renewal" etc.) and per-row toast buttons, audit-history link, PrototypeNotice "presence of this module does not establish compliance".
- /admin/legal-documents: DataTable (Title link /legal/{slug}, mono version, effective/updated dates, sections count), every row "Awaiting client approval" warning chip, placeholder-wording note card.
- /admin/theme: form (accent Select violet/ice/magenta, smoke-preset RadioGroup w/ ATMOSPHERE_PRESETS hints, animation + background intensity Sliders, typography scale Select, headline + footer-notice inputs) beside LIVE preview card (rounded-3xl; CSS radial-gradient smoke blobs react to preset/intensity — cinematic=3 animated blobs, reduced=1 static; heading gradient + button color follow accent; headline/footer text live). Save → toast "Prototype — theme not saved" + "Theme tokens are mock until KV config lands."
- /admin/settings: FormSections brand/locale-currency (mock)/contact/SEO/feature flags (Switches; purchasing+reviews off and disabled "Pending compliance review")/integration cards (D1, R2, KV, Auth neutral; age verification warning "Pending vendor"; WhatsApp "Out of scope") with disabled Configure + Tooltip "Secrets are never edited in-app"; Workers Secrets security note; Save → simulated toast.
- /admin/users: 5 invented admins (roles from ADMIN_ROLES names, status chips, last active), identity-provider note, Invite → simulated toast.
- /admin/roles: role cards from adminService.roles() (mono permission chips, members, "System" badge, disabled edit + Tooltip "Role enforcement arrives with the backend — proposed roles only"), disabled add-role card, prominent "PROPOSED examples, not implemented security boundaries" warning.
- /admin/audit-log: SearchField + severity FilterBar via adminService.auditLog, DataTable (Time/Actor/mono Action/Target/Severity StatusBadge info=ice warning=warning critical=error/IP) + Details button opening Radix Dialog with full event, mobileCard opens dialog, pagination, Export → toast "Prototype — export arrives with the backend".
- All dates formatted with explicit timeZone (UTC for date-only, Asia/Dubai for datetimes) to keep SSR/client hydration deterministic.
- Fixed in my files: 5 react-hooks/set-state-in-effect errors (moved setState into async callbacks / retry handlers), removed unused eslint-disable, added missing useEffect import in compliance view.
- Verified: tsc --noEmit clean for all 26 files; bun run lint exits 0; dev-server smoke test — all 18 route variants (incl. 3 not-found paths) returned 200 and render expected content (verified via curl greps).
- NOTE for orchestrator: src/components/shared/admin-shell.tsx (foundation) imports `AuditLog` from lucide-react which does not exist in this version — it 500s every /admin route via layout. I did NOT modify the foundation file (out of my scope); I temporarily patched+reverted it to verify my routes (icon fix: ScrollText, as used on line 9 and 85). This one-line fix must be applied by foundation owner.
Stage Summary:
- Admin part-2 complete: 10 route groups, 26 files, all lint/type-clean and runtime-verified against the dev server.
- Every interactive control either works on local state + honest toast, or is disabled with an explanatory tooltip; no mock action pretends to be real.
- Pending (not mine): foundation admin-shell.tsx `AuditLog` lucide import breaks /admin until fixed (one-liner above).

Task ID: 6-c
Agent: account-builder
Task: Build the complete customer account area for MIRAGE — shared account chrome plus 13 routes under /account (overview, sign-in, register, verify, forgot/reset-password, profile, security, preferences, saved, orders, order detail, privacy), frontend-only with simulated services and honest prototype messaging.

Work Log:
- Read worklog + foundation sources (accountService, orderHistoryService, saved-items store, mock data, forms/fields, status-badge, admin-primitives, ui/alert-dialog, use-toast) and reused them exclusively; no foundation files touched.
- Shared chrome (src/components/account/): account-nav.tsx (client — profile mini-header with gradient initials + verification badge; desktop vertical sticky top-24 card nav; mobile horizontal no-scrollbar chip row; usePathname + aria-current, exact-match for /account, prefix for children; active = border-violet-glow/40 bg-violet-glow/15); account-page.tsx (server-safe wrapper: Breadcrumbs Home/Account/{title} + ACCOUNT_PROTOTYPE_NOTICE + either PageHeading + lg:grid-cols-[16rem_1fr] nav layout, or centered max-w-md/lg auth layout for sign-in/register/verify/forgot/reset); order-format.ts (en-AE + Asia/Dubai Intl date formatter so SSR/client agree; itemsPreview summariser); order-item-image.tsx (client 64px next/image thumbnail with honest fallback when product assets are missing).
- /account overview (page + overview-view): hydration-safe time-aware greeting via useSyncExternalStore (server snapshot = "Welcome back"); profile summary, saved count (zustand), recent orders via orderHistoryService pageSize 2 with skeleton/error/retry, security snapshot (verification + sessions via accountService.sessions), quick-links grid.
- Auth routes: sign-in (glass card, Logo, zod safeParse field errors, remember-device checkbox described as non-persisting, submit → accountService.signIn → FormSuccess with the service's simulated message, LoadingIndicator inline in disabled submit); register (react-hook-form + zodResolver, live password requirement chips [10+ chars, number], required privacy checkbox erroring "You must accept the privacy notice", separate optional comms consents, legal links, success + PrototypeNotice about age verification being a separate flow); verify (server-only template — 3 steps all "Pending integration" badges, disabled dropzone with cursor-not-allowed + "Provider integration required", no fake success); forgot-password and reset-password (zod validation incl. match check; reset page states that the token param is ignored).
- /account/profile: RHF form loaded from accountService.getProfile (loading/error/retry states), email disabled with "Contact support to change", dirty-state Save (→ updateProfile + toast + FormSuccess), Cancel opens Radix AlertDialog "Discard changes?" when dirty, beforeunload guard while dirty.
- /account/security: change-password form (zod, simulated success), sessions from accountService.sessions with "This device" badge + per-session "Sign out" → toast "Prototype — sessions are mock", sign-out-all with AlertDialog confirm, new-device/recovery-code notification checkboxes, MFA placeholder (disabled Switch + "Coming with the identity provider integration").
- /account/preferences: prefs loaded via getPreferences; language Select (en-AE / ar-AE with Arabic-future-scope note), communications + privacy checkboxes, reducedMotion accessibility checkbox ("Respects your device setting by default; prototype stores nothing"), cookie-settings link, Save → updatePreferences → FormSuccess.
- /account/saved: resolves useSavedItems ids against CATALOG_ITEMS, ItemCard grid + explicit min-h-11 Remove control with toast, EmptyState action → /discover, session-local note.
- /account/orders: FilterBar (All + 7 statuses) → orderHistoryService.list pageSize 10 with CardGridSkeleton/EmptyState/ErrorState; card rows (mono reference, en-AE date with suppressHydrationWarning, itemsPreview summary, OrderStatusBadge, fulfilment label, chevron link), Pagination; loading is *derived* from a stale result key so no setState runs synchronously in effects (react-hooks/set-state-in-effect clean).
- /account/orders/[reference]: server page with generateStaticParams from ORDER_SUMMARIES + dynamic generateMetadata; params awaited as Promise; ORDER_DETAILS lookup → full record (status header card, vertical timeline with completed/pending dots, items list with OrderItemImage, status-history table, delivery/payment/total summary, DocumentCard documents, support link) or honest "Full record not available in this prototype" EmptyState with back link.
- /account/privacy: read-only stored-data review (fields from getProfile), data-access request via AlertDialog → submitPrivacyRequest("access") with 30-day SLA copy, account deletion via type-to-confirm "DELETE" AlertDialog → submitPrivacyRequest("deletion"), policy links, "No real requests leave the browser" note.
- Fixed 3 react-hooks/set-state-in-effect lint errors in my files (overview greeting via useSyncExternalStore; overview/orders fetch patterns restructured to intent+derived-loading). Full `bun run lint` exits 0; `tsc --noEmit` reports no errors under src/app/(site)/account or src/components/account; all 14 account routes smoke-tested 200 against the dev server.

Stage Summary:
- Account area complete: shared chrome (AccountPage/AccountNav) + overview, auth set (sign-in/register/verify/forgot/reset), profile, security, preferences, saved, orders list/detail, privacy — every screen carries the prototype notice and every "success" states it is simulated; nothing is written to localStorage and no real auth exists.
- Reusable additions for later tasks: AccountPage (nav + center layouts), ACCOUNT_PROTOTYPE_NOTICE, AccountNav, formatOrderDate/formatItemsPreview, OrderItemImage.
- Notes for other agents: dev server on :3000 intermittently dies under concurrent agent load (OOM/port races) — restart with `bun run dev`; /public/products + /public/brand images are still missing (404s in dev.log) — run scripts/generate-images.sh; links to /discover, /support, /help, /contact, /legal/* are placeholders until those routes land.

Task ID: 7-8 (integration + system pages)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Foundation fixes flagged by subagents, system state pages, documentation deliverables.

Work Log:
- Fixed foundation issues flagged by agents: (1) added --color-line / --color-line-strong Tailwind tokens to globals.css @theme (borders were silently missing site-wide); (2) replaced non-existent lucide `AuditLog` icon with `ScrollText` in admin-shell.tsx (500'd all /admin routes); (3) confirmed agent 6-a's pressTap import fix in item-card.tsx.
- Agent 6-e hit context deadline but completed ALL its files (verified: admin layout, overview, content hub/pages/editor, navigation, media, catalog hub/products/editor/categories all exist).
- Built system state pages: src/app/not-found.tsx (branded 404), src/app/error.tsx (global error boundary), (site)/maintenance, (site)/offline, (site)/restricted, (site)/session-expired.
- Wrote deliverable docs: README.md (install/dev/deploy, architecture, smoke engine, routes, a11y), .env.example (future var names only), docs/MOCK-FUNCTIONALITY.md, docs/FUTURE-BACKEND.md (service→D1/R2/KV map), docs/CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md (adapter recommendation + open decisions).
- Full lint clean. All 41+ routes smoke-tested via curl: 200s; unknown slugs 404. Dev log clean.
- Image generation: restarted batch with setsid (first attempt died with shell); aura-700.jpg confirmed generated.

Stage Summary:
- Entire route IA implemented. Lint clean, routes 200, docs complete.
- Remaining: browser E2E verification via agent-browser, responsive + sticky-footer checks.

Task ID: 10 (browser verification + fixes)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Agent-browser E2E verification of the golden paths, responsive checks, and fixes for every defect found.

Work Log:
- Verified via headless Chrome (desktop 1440 + mobile 375/390): homepage (hero, sections, scroll reveals), product detail (gallery/zoom, variant chips, warnings, disabled purchase, accordion, related), search (live results + count), discover (chips/filters/sort), saved (empty state + honest prototype note), account (overview, sign-in, orders detail), admin (dashboard, shell), FAQ (filter + accordion), legal (TOC + print), 404, footer, bottom nav.
- Fixed defect 1: SectionContainer lacked horizontal gutters → homepage sections touched viewport edge. Added px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 to SectionContainer (global, harmless where PageContainer nested).
- Fixed defect 2: page content overlapped the fixed header on Breadcrumbs-led pages (product, category, legal, orders detail). main now has pt-16; hero compensates with -mt-16 and grows to 100svh (full-bleed preserved).
- Fixed defect 3: product detail page had no saved-item control (spec requires saved-item state). Added ProductSaveButton client island wired to the mock store.
- Fixed defect 4: /offline crashed (500) — onClick in server component. Split into server page + OfflineActions client island.
- Fixed defect 5: system pages (offline/maintenance/restricted/session-expired) rendered duplicate chrome inside (site). Stripped self-contained headers; pages now compose with AppShell.
- Hardening: metadataBase env-based fallback (NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL ?? localhost) silences OG warning without hardcoding deployment hostnames; lucide AuditLog→ScrollText in admin shell; --color-line tokens added (agent-flagged).
- Generated all 20 brand images (17 product, 2 editorial, 1 OG crop via sharp) — z-ai CLI, rate-limit aware.
- Route sweep: 55+ routes → 200; unknown slugs → 404. Lint clean. TypeScript clean.
- Environment note: sandbox reaps background processes between tool sessions; dev server may need restart (scripts/dev-keeper.sh provided).

Stage Summary:
- Browser-verified interactive site. All acceptance criteria met that are verifiable in-browser: coherent routes, distinctive identity, working smoke effects, complete mobile nav, typed product data, account/admin prototypes with honest mock labels, loading/empty/error coverage, no responsive overflow found at tested widths.

Task ID: 11 (homepage neon redesign)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Apply LED neon accents + electric vibe, Cybertruck-style outlined headings, replace hero background with animated vapor scene, and rearrange homepage sections (hero > products > categories > brand collection > discover > the brand > rest).

Work Log:
- Font: added Orbitron (Cybertruck-esque squared techno face) as `--font-orbitron` in src/app/layout.tsx; exposed `--font-neon` token in globals.css @theme (generates `font-neon` utility).
- globals.css LED neon system: `--neon-{violet,soft,ice,magenta}` channel vars; utilities `text-neon`, `text-neon-ice`, `text-neon-outline`, `text-neon-outline-ice` (transparent fill + text-stroke + layered glow, paint-order stroke fill, @supports fallback to solid fill), `neon-glow-btn`/`-hover`, `neon-edge`, `neon-divider`; keyframes `neon-flicker`, `vapor-rise`, `vapor-sway`, `grid-pan`, `led-pulse`, `beam-sway`; utilities `anim-{flicker,vapor,sway,grid-pan,led,beam}`; `.vapor-grid` synthwave floor (rotateX perspective, masked); new type scale `--text-hero-neon` / `--text-h2-neon` (Orbitron runs wide); all new anims disabled under prefers-reduced-motion (plumes park mid-frame at 0.22 opacity).
- New src/components/atmosphere/vapor-hero-scene.tsx: replaces the orb/rings HeroVisual — 7 rising LED-tinted vapor plumes (rise+sway nested keyframes, blurred columns), striped synthwave neon sun + halo, scrolling perspective grid floor with glowing horizon tube, twin swaying LED beams, floating glow orbs, base electric radial field, reused AtmosphericParticles canvas. Pure CSS transform/opacity motion, pointer-events-none, reduced-motion static fallback.
- HeroSection reworked: VaporHeroScene backdrop; h1 line 1 "Crafted vapor." lit neon fill, line 2 "Elevated atmosphere." hollow LED outline + slow flicker (both Orbitron uppercase, text-hero-neon); eyebrow chip got pulsing LED dot + violet border glow; primary CTA uses neon-glow-btn with hover intensify + lift; secondary CTA ice glow border; micro-label separators are staggered pulsing LED dots; scroll indicator targets #products with glow hover.
- New src/components/homepage/neon-heading.tsx (NeonHeading): LED eyebrow (pulsing dot + label + neon hairline) + Orbitron uppercase h2, filled `title` + optional outline `accent` word (violet or ice tint) with subtle flicker.
- New src/components/homepage/neon-divider.tsx (NeonDivider): dual neon hairlines + 3 staggered charging LED dots.
- New src/components/homepage/product-categories-section.tsx: "Product categories" band — NeonHeading ("Shop the RANGE" ice outline), all 5 CATALOG_CATEGORIES via CategoryCard, "All categories" → /categories.
- New src/components/homepage/brand-collection-section.tsx: LED-framed editorial banner — neon top rail + neon-edge panel, "ONE RANGE. EVERY DETAIL." (ice outline), copy, 3 stat chips (Orbitron values), CTAs to /discover + /categories, framed /brand/atelier.jpg with corner LED ticks + graceful fallback.
- Re-themed existing sections: CollectionPreview (eyebrow "Products", "SELECTED PIECES" outline accent, id="products", "View the full range" chip), DiscoverSection ("EXPLORE FURTHER" ice outline), BrandIntroSection (NeonHeading "AN ATMOSPHERE, NOT A STOREFRONT.", NeonDivider transition replaces old hairline+diamond, neon-framed image + story CTA chip), CompanySection (NeonHeading + Orbitron stat figures), SupportSection ("NEED A HAND?" ice outline), SafetySection (calm amber/violet LED top rail, Orbitron heading, glow hover chips — compliance copy untouched).
- page.tsx reordered: Hero > CollectionPreview > ProductCategoriesSection > BrandCollectionSection > DiscoverSection > BrandIntroSection > CompanySection > SafetySection > SupportSection.
- Browser-verified (agent-browser): desktop 1440+1920 (hero neon/outline headings, grid+sun+vapor, all 9 sections render, footer natural push) and mobile 390 (stacked layout, no overflow); interactions verified — hero CTA → /discover, scroll indicator → #products, category card → /categories/pod-systems; console clean; no dev.log errors.
- Fixed during verification: NeonDivider root had `relative` conflicting with caller's `absolute` (Tailwind cascade order) causing an 8px horizontal overflow on mobile — removed the root position class; positioning is caller-supplied. Re-verified overflow = 0px.

Stage Summary:
- Homepage now carries the full LED-neon electric identity: Orbitron outlined major headings, animated vapor hero (plumes/synthwave grid/neon sun/beams), neon section banding via NeonHeading/NeonDivider, and the requested order hero > products > categories > brand collection > discover > the brand > company > safety > support.
- Reusable artifacts: `font-neon`, text-neon(-outline[-ice]) utilities, neon keyframes (flicker/vapor/led/grid/beam), VaporHeroScene, NeonHeading, NeonDivider — available for future pages.
- Lint clean; all routes smoke-checked 200; mobile + desktop verified with zero horizontal overflow and no console errors.

Task ID: 12-b
Agent: full-stack-developer
Task: Implement the complete frontend-only ordering system — AED pricing, in-memory cart store, /cart, /checkout (RHF+zod, 18+ gate), /checkout/success, order creation into placed-orders store, and full UI wiring (product order actions, card quick-add, header/bottom-nav cart badges, copy sweep).

Work Log:
- Read worklog (foundation + Task 11) and absorbed patterns from types, orders/catalog data+services, saved-items store, product page islands, shared components, layout nav, account orders, saved page+view, safety-section; confirmed toast stack = shadcn use-toast (src/hooks/use-toast) with ToastAction.
- Types (src/types/index.ts): added `price: number` + `compareAtPrice?: number` to CatalogItem; added CartLine, CartLineDetail, CartTotals, CartDetail, DeliveryMethod, PaymentMethod. Changed `ageRestricted` from literal `true` to `boolean` — this fixed 3 pre-existing tsc errors (coils/accessories data carries `false`; nothing consumed the literal type).
- Pricing (src/data/catalog.ts): all 12 products priced in AED per band — disposables 45/65, pods 149/169, liquids 65/59/85, kits 429/365, coils+accessories 35/45/19; compareAtPrice on aura-700 (55), dune-pro-2500 (79), sirocco-salt-30 (72) for strikethrough + Save chip.
- src/lib/utils.ts: added formatAED (whole-dirham display, 2-dp fallback, en-AE locale).
- src/services/cart.ts: useCart zustand store (mirror of saved-items, in-memory, NO localStorage) — lines {productSlug, variantId|null, qty}, addItem (increment on same line key, cap 99), removeLine, setQty (qty<1 removes), clear; line key `${slug}:${variantId ?? "-"}`. cartService.getCartDetail resolves against CATALOG_ITEMS → CartLineDetail[] (silent drop of stale lines; blocked flag + reason for out_of_stock/unavailable product or dead/unavailable variant; excluded from totals), totals with subtotal / deliveryFee (free standard ≥ AED 200 else 25; express 35) / total / itemCount; deliveryFeeFor + DELIVERY_METHODS shared so cart and checkout totals always agree; firstAvailableVariantId for quick-adds.
- src/services/placed-orders.ts: usePlacedOrders store (summaries newest-first + details map) + service facade.
- src/services/checkout.ts: checkoutService.placeOrder(payload) — ~1.2s latency, throws on empty cart, builds OrderSummary + OrderDetail filling every required field (reference `MIR-${Date.now().toString(36).toUpperCase()}`, status "processing", itemsPreview ≤3, fulfilmentLabel per method, timeline with Dubai-tz stamps, items with variantLabel/lineTotalLabel/image, statusHistory, supportHref, deliveryLabel echoing city+emirate, paymentLabel from method incl. "Saved card ending •• 4021 (mock)", totalLabel); prepends to placed-orders store.
- /cart (page + cart-view): line rows (thumbnail, name link, variant chip, unit price, 44px-target qty stepper, line total, remove w/ toast), blocked lines dimmed with StatusBadge + "Excluded from totals", scrollable list beyond 4 lines (custom neon scrollbar), summary card (subtotal, delivery + free-delivery progress note, total, neon "Proceed to checkout" CTA, 18+/payment microcopy), EmptyState → /discover, PrototypeNotice.
- /checkout (page + checkout-view): react-hook-form + zod v4 (name/email/phone regex, emirate select of the 7 UAE emirates, city, street, optional note ≤200, delivery method radio Standard/Express with dynamic free-over-200 description, payment radio cash/card-on-delivery/mock saved card, REQUIRED 18+ checkbox with nicotine warning text); order-review sidebar (lines + subtotal/delivery/total that re-computes per delivery method, sticky on lg); submit → spinner "Placing order…" → placeOrder → clear cart → router.push /checkout/success?ref=…; empty-cart and blocked-items guards with honest messaging.
- /checkout/success (page + success-view): reads ?ref= via useSearchParams (Suspense-wrapped), neon Orbitron "ORDER PLACED" heading + glowing check, reference chip, summary lines w/ images + delivery/payment/total, CTAs → /account/orders + /discover; graceful "Confirmation not found" fallback explaining in-memory session storage.
- Product page: added AED price block (strikethrough + Save chip) near title; replaced disabled "Purchasing coming soon" button + PrototypeNotice with new product-order-actions.tsx island (controlled VariantPicker — now value/onChange with exported initialVariantSelection/primaryVariantId helpers; Add to cart w/ toast + "View cart" action; Buy now = add + route /checkout; blocked products/variants disable both with labels; microcopy row). mobile-summary.tsx fixed bar now shows price + Add to cart (rendered by the island so selection always agrees). Kept safety warnings + conformity info untouched; updated description-accordion disclaimer copy.
- item-card.tsx: price row (formatAED + optional strikethrough) + quick-add ShoppingBag icon button (first available variant, toast with View cart action, stopPropagation so the card Link never fires, disabled+labelled when blocked).
- site-header.tsx: cart icon link with live violet count badge beside Saved; bottom-navigation.tsx: "Search" slot → "Cart" (nav data mob-search→mob-cart, icon map + live badge); mobile-navigation.tsx drawer primary links now include Cart.
- Copy sweep: safety-section.tsx replaced the disabled-purchase paragraph with an ordering info strip (Free delivery over AED 200 · 18+ age-verified delivery · Cash & card on delivery · UAE-wide) while keeping the bold nicotine warning prominent; faqs.ts (2 order answers), site-settings.ts complianceNotice, account/orders page lead + [reference] note all updated; account orders-view now merges session-placed orders (violet "This session" chip, links to their confirmation) above sample records; docs/MOCK-FUNCTIONALITY.md cart/ordering rows + implemented/not-built lists updated. Admin roadmap rows intentionally untouched; brand-collection/brand-intro "photography — coming soon" image captions untouched (parallel agent owns those files, and they are image captions, not purchasing copy).
- Fixed pre-existing tsc errors surfaced in catalog.ts (ageRestricted literal vs false) via the type widening above; examples/skills template errors left alone (out of project scope).
- Verification: bunx tsc --noEmit clean for src/; bun run lint exits 0 with zero problems; dev-server smoke — /, /cart, /checkout, /checkout/success?ref=…, /products/aura-700, /account/orders, /discover, /saved all 200; curl greps confirm AED prices on product/category/homepage cards, Add to cart/Buy now on product pages, empty states on cart/checkout, and the new ordering band + nicotine warning on the homepage; dev.log clean.

Stage Summary:
- Ordering system complete and lint/type-clean: priced catalog → quick-add/price on cards → product ordering island → /cart with totals and free-delivery logic → validated /checkout with 18+ gate → simulated order creation into an in-memory placed-orders store → /checkout/success confirmation → session orders surfaced in /account/orders. All state is in-memory by design (mirrors saved-items; no localStorage, no backend, no API routes); payments remain honestly mocked everywhere.
- Files created: services/cart.ts, services/placed-orders.ts, services/checkout.ts, app/(site)/cart/{page,cart-view}.tsx, app/(site)/checkout/{page,checkout-view}.tsx, app/(site)/checkout/success/{page,success-view}.tsx, app/(site)/products/[slug]/product-order-actions.tsx.
- Files modified: types/index.ts, data/catalog.ts, data/navigation.ts, data/site-settings.ts, lib/utils.ts, app/(site)/products/[slug]/{page,variant-picker,mobile-summary}.tsx, components/shared/item-card.tsx, components/layout/{site-header,bottom-navigation,mobile-navigation}.tsx, components/homepage/safety-section.tsx, app/(site)/account/orders/{page,orders-view}.tsx + [reference]/page.tsx, app/(site)/help/faq/faqs.ts, docs/MOCK-FUNCTIONALITY.md.
- TODO for later agents: persisted carts/orders arrive with the D1 backend (contracts already match OrderSummary/OrderDetail); /checkout/success could deep-link placed orders into a real order-detail page once history is backend-backed; optionally merge placed orders into account overview's "recent orders".

Task ID: 12-a
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Visual overhaul per user feedback — heavier multi-colour neon (red channel added), lots of VISIBLE moving smoke everywhere, integration of the ordering system, full browser verification.

Work Log:
- User feedback addressed: (1) smoke was too subtle to register as moving, (2) neon needed more weight + a red channel, (3) "apply lots of smoke", (4) ordering missing (handled by 12-b).
- globals.css: added --neon-red/--neon-red-soft channels + --red/--red-soft brand tokens + --color-led-red(-soft) Tailwind mappings; boosted every neon utility (text-neon 4-layer shadow, outlines 1.5px stroke + stronger halos); NEW text-neon-red, text-neon-mix (violet/magenta/red/ice mixed sign), text-neon-outline-red; neon-glow-btn/neon-edge/neon-divider strengthened (divider + button halos now carry red); smoke-drift-a/b/c keyframes rewritten with much larger travel/scale/rotate; NEW smoke-churn-a/b (aggressive billowing) + smoke-fog-x (lateral floor fog) keyframes + .anim-churn-*/.anim-fog-x classes; default drift durations cut (46-64s → 34-48s); reduced-motion kill list extended.
- Smoke engine (lib/atmosphere.ts + smoke-layer.tsx): drift union changed to class-suffix form (drift-a/churn-a/...); ambient preset 3→6 layers @ intensity 1.05, cinematic 5→9 layers @ 1.2 — RED (#ff2a54/#ff5c74) mixed into every preset, durations 24-50s, particle counts/opacity raised; AmbientSmoke palettes gained "inferno" (violet+ice → hot reds), SectionAtmosphere variant union extended.
- AppShell: page-level fixed AmbientSmoke intensity 0.5 → 0.85 (dense mixed smoke on every public page).
- VaporHeroScene: plume field 7 → 14 (four LED channels incl. red), opacities/durations retuned so several plumes are always mid-travel; added red radial to base field, red rim + red top on the synthwave sun, third (red) LED beam, TWO low fog banks sliding along the grid floor, red segment + red glow in the horizon tube, motes 46 → 60.
- Homepage red accents: hero eyebrow LED dot → red; hero line 1 → text-neon-mix; micro-label dots now violet/ice/red; NeonHeading gained tone (violet|ice|red|mix) + redAccent props with tone-matched eyebrow dot; NeonDivider now carries 4 charging dots (violet/ice/red/magenta); ProductCategoriesSection heading accent → red outline + atmosphere → inferno 0.55; BrandCollectionSection rail/wash gradients carry red + "12" stat chip lit red; CollectionPreview + DiscoverSection gained their own SectionAtmosphere layers (violet 0.5 / mixed 0.45) so every band smokes; brand-intro ice intensity 0.5 → 0.65.
- Ordering integration hardening (on top of 12-b): cart + placed-orders stores upgraded from in-memory to sessionStorage persistence (src/lib/session-storage.ts; validate-on-load, restore after hydration commit via setTimeout to avoid SSR mismatches, subscribe-to-persist) — carts and confirmations now survive reloads/direct navigation within the tab; cart-view/checkout-view/success-view gated on new hydrated flags with LED "Restoring…" states; stale "stored in memory" copy updated on success page + docs/MOCK-FUNCTIONALITY.md.
- Verification (agent-browser): desktop 1440 — hero mixed neon + red sun rim + grid confirmed, smoke animations RUNNING (17 page layers + 14 plumes, playState=running), prices/quick-add on cards, red RANGE outline, brand collection red accents; E2E order placed (Aura 700 Arctic Mint → AED 45 + AED 25 → AED 70, ref MIR-MVFU66AX) via cart → checkout (validated form, 18+ gate) → success page; confirmation SURVIVED full reload; order appears in /account/orders as Processing. Mobile 375 — no horizontal overflow, bottom-nav Cart, empty-cart state + footer behaviour verified. Zero page errors; dev.log clean; bun run lint 0 problems; tsc clean for src/ (examples/skills template errors pre-existing, out of scope).

Stage Summary:
- The homepage now reads as a bold multi-channel LED room: violet+ice+magenta+RED neon (mixed-glow headlines, red accents in every band) over dense, clearly-moving smoke (14 hero plumes + fog banks + 6-9 layer section/page fields with churn/drift/fog motion).
- Ordering loop is complete and reload-proof: priced catalog → add-to-cart (cards/product/mobile bar) → sessionStorage-backed /cart → validated /checkout with 18+ gate → simulated order creation → /checkout/success → /account/orders "This session" history.
- Killed a real UX bug from 12-b: full page loads previously emptied the cart; now session-persisted.

Task ID: 13
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: WhatsApp checkout implementation, double-layer multi-colour neon stroke, transparent smoke PNG assets, browsing-speed optimisation, admin pages verification.

Work Log:
- WhatsApp ordering (wa.me deep links): new services/whatsapp.ts (WHATSAPP_NUMBER + display, buildWhatsAppLink/openWhatsApp, composeCheckoutMessage incl. any form fields already typed, composeCartMessage, composeOrderConfirmationMessage, composeSupportMessage); site-settings contact.whatsapp added (+971 50 000 0000). New shared WhatsAppOrderButton (green LED chip) + WhatsAppIcon (official glyph, lucide has no brands). Wired into: cart summary ("Order via WhatsApp"), checkout sidebar ("Send order via WhatsApp" — pulls live form values + cart + totals), success page ("Confirm via WhatsApp" — sends reference + summary), footer (icon chip + "WhatsApp orders: <number>" line). Admin settings integrations row updated from "Out of scope" → "Prototype live" with wa.me detail.
- Double-layer neon: globals.css new trio text-neon-outline-duo / -duo-ice / -duo-red — element carries BOLD em-scaled outer stroke (0.062em, ~4px at hero size) in the primary channel while a ::before ghost fed by data-text draws a thinner (0.52×) contrasting stroke (violet+ice, ice+violet, red+magenta) = two concentric LED tubes; heavier mixed glows; existing outline utilities thickened 1.5px → 0.048em em-scaled; filled text-neon/-mix gained a white core stroke (0.018–0.022em) for the "double layer" lit-tube look; @supports fallback hides ::before ghosts. Applied: hero line 2 (data-text set) + every NeonHeading accent (component sets data-text automatically, tone-mapped duo classes).
- Transparent smoke PNGs: generated 3 white-smoke-on-black plates (z-ai CLI, 1344x768/768x1344) → scripts/smoke-keying.ts (sharp luminance keying: floor threshold 16, gamma 0.85 curve, white RGB + alpha=luminance, palette-quantised PNG 85) → public/smoke/{smoke-plume,smoke-wisps,smoke-column}.png (132–204 KB, 31–61% fully transparent). New SmokeTexture component: colour layer masked by PNG alpha (mask-image/size/position/repeat as SEPARATE props — the shorthand suffix form is invalid and renders unmasked rectangles), mix-blend-screen, drift/churn/fog keyframes, MotionBoundary pause + reduced-motion park. Integrated: 4 tinted layers in VaporHeroScene (violet wisps, red plume flipped, violet-soft column, ice floor fog), 1 page-wide layer in AmbientSmoke (palette-tinted, gated off in reduced).
- Speed: next.config experimental.optimizePackageImports (lucide-react, framer-motion, radix-slot), compress on, poweredByHeader off; preload of smoke-wisps in root head + plume/column preloads on homepage (CSS-mask images are discovered late); OrderItemImage loading="eager" (was LCP warning on confirmation pages); html[data-scroll-behavior=smooth] kills Next route-transition warning. Turbopack cache corrupted mid-session (panics + 5.2min cache writes) — fixed by rm -rf .next + restart; compile times back to sub-second.
- Admin pages verified: all 14 routes (admin, orders, catalog ×3 incl. product editor, customers, compliance, content ×2 incl. page editor, legal-documents, media, navigation, roles, settings, support, theme, users, audit-log) → 200 with full consoles; browser-checked dashboard shell + settings page visually.
- Verification (agent-browser): hero duo stroke + photographic smoke + grid confirmed desktop 1440 & mobile 390 (0px overflow); 98 CSS animations running, 10 masked texture layers, 7 duo headings; E2E order MIR-MVFVU0KU placed (cart → checkout form → 18+ gate → success); window.open hook captured all three WhatsApp messages — cart message (items+subtotal), checkout message (items + Standard delivery + AED 70 total + typed name/phone/address/payment), confirmation message (reference + total + delivery + payment) — all correctly framed with the 18+ footer; footer + admin rows verified; console clean after LCP + scroll-behavior fixes; bun run lint 0 problems; tsc 0 errors in src/.

Stage Summary:
- Conversational WhatsApp ordering is now a first-class checkout channel: every order surface (cart, checkout, confirmation, footer) opens a pre-filled wa.me chat whose message mirrors the live cart/totals/form state; the number is settings-driven and admin labels it "Prototype live".
- Headings carry true double-layer multi-colour neon (two concentric strokes, em-scaled, bold & heavy) and every atmosphere layer now includes REAL keyed photographic smoke tinted to the LED palette.
- Speed wins shipped: bundle-optimising imports, texture preloads, eager LCP images, clean cache. All 20 public + 14 admin routes 200; lint/type clean.

Task ID: 14
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Remove the previous (non-smoke) animations from the hero section and keep only the smoke.

Work Log:
- User feedback: the hero still carried the earlier vaporwave animations; only the smoke should remain.
- vapor-hero-scene.tsx stripped to a smoke-only scene. REMOVED: striped synthwave neon sun (disc + red rim + halo + anim-breathe), three sweeping LED beams (anim-beam), two floating glow orbs (anim-float), synthwave grid floor + horizon tube + horizon haze (vapor-grid + anim-grid-pan), and the electric motes canvas (AtmosphericParticles import + particleCount prop).
- KEPT/ENRICHED smoke: static neon colour wash retained as non-animated lighting; photographic SmokeTexture layers raised from 4 to 5 (new magenta wisps layer fills the upper-right area where the sun used to sit; existing layers' opacity bumped 0.3-0.5 -> 0.32-0.55); plume field 14 -> 16 (added magenta + ice plumes at 10%/80%); fog banks 2 -> 3 (new magenta bank at bottom 22%). All motion stays pure CSS transform/opacity; reduced-motion and MotionBoundary behaviour unchanged.
- hero-section.tsx docstring updated (no more grid/sun/beams wording). globals.css utilities (anim-beam/grid-pan/breathe/float) left in place — still used by ambient-lighting.tsx and legacy hero-visual.tsx elsewhere.
- Verification (agent-browser, dev server restarted after sandbox reaped it): desktop 1440 — vapor-grid=0, anim-beam=0, anim-breathe=0, anim-float=0, canvas=0, 16 plumes + 33 smoke texture layers present, 97 animations running; two frames 4s apart show the smoke visibly travelled. Mobile 390 — 0px horizontal overflow, hero dense with smoke, neon duo headings intact. Console clean (only HMR/DevTools notices); no page errors; footer push + WhatsApp footer line intact; lint exit 0; tsc clean for src/ (only pre-existing out-of-scope skills/ template errors).

Stage Summary:
- The hero is now a pure smoke room: tinted photographic smoke + rising LED plumes + sliding fog over a static neon wash — every previous background animation removed as requested. Double-layer neon headings, CTAs, ordering flows and all other sections untouched.

Task ID: 15
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Fix "scrolling not smooth" and resolve "old hero animations still exist" report.

Work Log:
- Diagnosis: (1) The served homepage HTML provably contains ZERO old hero animations (curl grep + DOM counts: vapor-grid/anim-beam/anim-breathe/anim-float/canvas all 0) — the user's preview was showing a stale cached page; hard refresh fixes it. (2) The "orbs" the user still saw were real but different: the page-level AmbientSmoke engine drew six 78–90vmax radial-gradient blobs with blur(90–130px) + mix-blend-mode:screen — giant glowing orbs, and the single worst scroll-performance cost on the site (also per-section copies).
- Smoke engine rebuilt around the keyed PNGs: lib/atmosphere.ts presets switched from SmokeLayerConfig blobs to SmokeTextureConfig textures (asset/width/x/y/opacity/drift/flip); ambient 6 blobs → 4 textures, cinematic 9 → 6, reduced 1 static; blur field eliminated entirely.
- ambient-smoke.tsx now renders tinted SmokeTexture layers only; SmokeLayer component deleted (smoke-layer.tsx removed); palette mapping + parallax + MotionBoundary pausing preserved.
- SmokeTexture: dropped persistent will-change (animation auto-promotes; cuts GPU layer memory).
- Hero: plume blurs 28–42px → 20–29px, fog banks 30–34px → 20–22px, hero texture blurs 1–3px → 0–1px; removed backdrop-blur from hero eyebrow chip + scroll indicator (bg-black/30, bg-black/50 instead).
- Footer: dropped backdrop-blur-xl for solid bg-[#08050d] (sticky-header-style re-blur of scrolling content killed).
- globals.css: removed now-dead .vapor-grid, @utility anim-grid-pan/anim-beam, @keyframes grid-pan/beam-sway (a stray duplicate .vapor-grid introduced mid-edit was removed too); reduced-motion kill list updated.
- Verification (agent-browser): blur audit — 20 blur layers total vs ~50 before; only "big" ones are a blur(1px) hero texture and one blur(20px) fog bank (was blur(90–130px) on multi-megapixel elements). Scroll FPS test (rAF counter + full-page programmatic scroll, headless SwiftShader): 41.1 FPS scrolling vs 51.4 idle — smooth on real GPUs; pre-fix the fixed blurred blobs would have tanked headless far below this. Old animations still 0; 16 hero plumes + texture atmospheres confirmed rendering on hero/products/categories/discover bands (screenshots desktop 1440 + mobile 390, 0px overflow); console clean; lint 0 problems; tsc clean for src/ (only pre-existing examples/ + skills/ template errors).

Stage Summary:
- The entire site's ambient smoke is now real keyed-PNG vapor (no gradient blobs, no CSS blur monsters) — denser-looking AND dramatically cheaper: blur layers ~50→20 with the largest radius 130px→20px, plus zero backdrop-filters on scroll-visible chrome. The "orbs" are gone; smoke texture reads as actual smoke.
- Old hero animations remain fully removed (0 in served HTML/DOM); the user's stale preview needed a hard refresh, not a code change.

Task ID: 16-e
Agent: frontend-styling-expert (subagent)
Task: Reposition the homepage copy and sections for the MIRAGE marketplace pivot (multi-brand vapor mall) — keep every neon class, animation and structural pattern; change words and rebuild the brand-collection right panel as the brand wall.

Work Log:
- data/site-settings.ts: tagline → "The UAE's neon-lit vapor marketplace"; description → marketplace copy (twelve leading brands, authenticity-checked stock, transparent AED pricing, WhatsApp ordering, UAE-wide delivery from the Dubai warehouse); seo.defaultDescription updated to match. complianceNotice + ageRestrictionNotice untouched.
- hero-section.tsx (same neon treatment, entrance staggers, LED eyebrow chip): line 1 "Every brand." (text-neon-mix), line 2 "One marketplace." (text-neon-outline-duo with data-text + anim-flicker); lead paragraph → "From Elf Bar to Al Fakher — twelve leading vapor brands, authenticity-checked stock, AED pricing and WhatsApp ordering. MIRAGE is the UAE's neon-lit vapor marketplace."; HERO_MICRO_LABELS → 12 leading brands / Authenticity-checked stock / Dubai warehouse · UAE-wide (aria-label → "Marketplace assurances"); primary CTA → "Shop the marketplace" (/discover unchanged), secondary → "Browse brands" (/brand unchanged).
- brand-collection-section.tsx REBUILT as THE BRAND WALL (centerpiece): neon-edge panel, radial vapor wash + LED top rail kept byte-identical. Left: eyebrow chip "The brand wall" (LED dot), heading `<span class="text-neon">Twelve brands.</span> <span class="text-neon-outline-ice" (anim-flicker)>One marketplace.</span>`, brand-wall paragraph naming all twelve brands, CTAs "All brands" → /brand (neon-glow-btn) + "Shop collections" → /collections (border secondary). Right: framed atelier image REPLACED by responsive 2/3-col ul grid of all 12 BRANDS tiles (Link → /brand/<slug>, rounded-xl border-line bg-white/[0.03] px-3 py-2.5, font-neon text-[0.72rem] uppercase name tinted by brand.accent → violet-soft/ice/magenta-glow, text-[0.68rem] count "{n} products" computed from CATALOG_ITEMS where item.brand === brand.name; aria-label per tile, focus-visible ring). Removed COLLECTION_STATS, imgFailed state and next/image import; added BRANDS/CATALOG_ITEMS/Brand imports.
- product-categories-section.tsx: chip "All categories" → "All collections", href /categories → /collections; heading kept per instruction; docstring wording → shop-by-collection.
- collection-preview.tsx: NeonHeading eyebrow stays "Products", title "Selected" → "Trending", accent "pieces" → "now" (renders Trending NOW; component sets data-text); chip "View the full range" → "View the full marketplace" (/discover unchanged).
- brand-intro-section.tsx: eyebrow "The brand" → "The marketplace"; NeonHeading "AN ATMOSPHERE, NOT A STOREFRONT." kept; body → marketplace story (curates twelve leading brands in one place — authenticated stock, transparent AED pricing, Dubai-warehouse dispatch, WhatsApp ordering on every listing; walk the wall / order in a single message); CTA chip → "About the marketplace" href /about; /brand/craft.jpg kept, alt reframed to the marketplace wall, fallback caption → "Marketplace photography — coming soon".
- discover-section.tsx: "Our craft" card → title "All brands", body "Twelve leading vapor brands in one marketplace." (href /brand unchanged); all other cards untouched.
- company-section.tsx: COMPANY_STATS → 2021 "Trading from Dubai since", 12 "Brands on the wall", 44 "Products listed", "UAE-wide" "Delivery coverage" (compact text-2xl sm:text-3xl via optional flag so Orbitron value fits mobile 2-col grid); heading "Small range." → "Curated stock." (accent "Full paper trail." kept); body paragraph → multi-brand marketplace framing. Orbitron stat styling unchanged.
- app/(site)/page.tsx: section order untouched; metadata title → "The UAE's neon-lit vapor marketplace" (description already settings-driven).
- Untouched as instructed: products/brand/collections routes, item-card.tsx, category-card.tsx, atmosphere/*.
- Verification: bunx tsc --noEmit — zero errors in src/ (only pre-existing examples/ + skills/ template errors); bun run lint — 0 problems; curl / → 200: data-text="One marketplace.", "Every brand.", "All brands", all 12 /brand/<slug> tile links, "All collections", "Trending NOW", tile counts (2-5 per brand, sum 43 = live catalog), "Shop the marketplace", "Browse brands", title tag updated; old copy confirmed gone ("Crafted vapor", "Enter the collection", "Our craft", "Elevated atmosphere", "All categories", "Selected", "Batch-traceable", "Product families" all 0).

Stage Summary:
- The homepage now reads as the UAE's neon-lit vapor marketplace end to end: hero ("Every brand. / One marketplace."), Trending NOW products strip, All collections chip, the BRAND WALL centerpiece (12 live-count tiles linking to /brand/<slug> inside the same LED-framed panel), All brands discover card, marketplace story band, and marketplace company stats — with zero changes to the neon design language, animations, smoke or section order.
- Note: task brief said catalog has 44 products; live CATALOG_ITEMS currently holds 43 (parallel agent still populating). The brand wall computes counts from the data at render time so tiles are always accurate; the company-section "44 Products listed" stat follows the task instruction.

Task ID: 16-c
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Brand directory (/brand) + brand landing pages (/brand/[slug]) for the multi-brand MIRAGE marketplace, plus the shared BrandCard neon tile.

Work Log:
- Created src/components/shared/brand-card.tsx (new, nobody owned it): Link-rooted tile → /brand/<slug> with min-h-44, rounded-2xl border-line bg-elevated/45 p-5 sm:p-6, hover:-translate-y-1. Accent channels exported as BRAND_ACCENT_HEX (violet #8b5cf6 / ice #6fd6f2 / magenta #d75fd4) + BRAND_ACCENT_GLOW rgba companions and applied via inline styles only (name textShadow, LED dot bg+glow, count-chip border/color, ArrowRight drop-shadow) so Tailwind arbitrary classes stay clean; hover border-glow is a colour-carrying overlay span faded in with group-hover/group-focus-visible. Content: font-neon Orbitron bold uppercase name (text-base sm:text-lg), tagline text-[0.78rem], tiny rounded-full chips (origin, est. {established}, accent-tinted "{n} products"), anim-led dot (size-1.5, --dur 2.2s) on featured brands only, aria-label on the link.
- Rewrote src/app/(site)/brand/page.tsx as the Brands directory (route kept exactly at /brand): Breadcrumbs Home → Brands; sr-only h1 + NeonHeading (eyebrow "Marketplace directory", title "TWELVE BRANDS", accent "ONE MARKETPLACE.", tone mix) over SectionAtmosphere variant="mixed" intensity 0.45 in a relative host; intro copy = UAE's vapor marketplace, Al Fakher to Silvaper, authenticity-checked stock, AED pricing; grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 of 12 BrandCards in a semantic ul, productCount computed from CATALOG_ITEMS (item.brand === brand.name — 43 listings total); kept /brand/craft.jpg as a decorative framed band (aspect-[16/9], rounded-2xl, border-violet-glow/30, Image fill object-cover, alt "Inside the MIRAGE marketplace studio") paired with a "Curated, checked, listed." column and closing CTAs to /collections + /about. generateMetadata title "Brands — MIRAGE Vapor Marketplace".
- Created src/app/(site)/brand/[slug]/page.tsx: generateStaticParams over BRANDS, params Promise<{slug}>, unknown slug → notFound(); generateMetadata title `${brand.name} — products at MIRAGE` + blurb description. Hero: SectionAtmosphere variant mapped from accent (violet/ice/magenta) intensity 0.6 + inline radial-gradient glow div; eyebrow row with accent anim-led dot + "MARKETPLACE BRAND"; h1 brand.name text-h1 font-bold with accent color + layered textShadow glow inline; tagline text-lead; chip row origin · est. · {count} products; description paragraph max-w-2xl. "Products by {brand.name}" section: ItemGrid columns=3 fed by CATALOG_ITEMS filtered item.brand === brand.name with the featured-first/name sort matching brandsService.brandItems; bottom CTA row cards → /collections ("Browse all collections") + /about ("About the marketplace"). Touched nothing outside brand-card.tsx + the two brand routes.
- Environment note: dev server had been reaped mid-session (port 3000 refused); restarted it in background (nohup bun run dev >> dev.log) — all verification ran against the fresh process.

Stage Summary:
- The brand route now serves the marketplace: /brand is a 12-tile neon directory (accent-coded glow tiles, LED dots on the 7 featured brands, live product counts) and every /brand/<slug> is an accent-lit landing page (violet/ice/magenta atmosphere + radial glow, LED h1, meta chips, brand story, full product grid, collections/about CTAs) — 11 of 12 slugs + index statically generated, unknown slugs 404.
- Verification: bunx tsc --noEmit → only pre-existing examples/ + skills/ errors; bun run lint → 0 problems; curl: /brand 200, /brand/elf-bar 200 (60× "Elf Bar", 5 ×2 /products/ hrefs, tagline present), /brand/al-fakher 200 (title "Al Fakher Vape — products at MIRAGE", 3 product links), /brand/nonexistent 404, plus /brand/silvaper /brand/tugboat /brand/vozol 200; /brand HTML contains all 12 est. chips + 7 featured LED dots. dev.log clean for brand routes (parallel /categories 307s belong to another agent's task).

Task ID: 16-d
Agent: Z.ai Code
Task: Marketplace cleanup of the individual product page + brand identity on cards (stripped compliance/safety/compatibility surfaces, added marketplace brand chip + /collections breadcrumbs).

Work Log:
- src/app/(site)/products/[slug]/page.tsx: removed the "compatibility", "manufacturer", "safety" and "compliance" accordion panels entirely (panels array now = description, specifications, optional faqs) and deleted the prominent "Safety warnings" note box from the info column. Cleaned imports/constants: dropped Check/FileCheck2/FileWarning/Hourglass (lucide), StatusBadge, DocumentCard and the CONFORMITY_TONE/LABEL/ICON map; kept TriangleAlert (still used by the 18+ chip) and AvailabilityBadge.
- Brand chip: brandByName(item.brand) from @/data/brands resolves the marketplace brand; the old plain <p> label is now a rounded-full violet chip (border-violet-glow/40, bg-white/[0.03], text-label uppercase tracking-[0.22em] text-violet-soft, self-start) linking to /brand/<slug> with a size-1.5 glowing LED dot (box-shadow 0 0 8px 2px rgba(167,139,250,0.7)) + aria-label "View all <brand> products"; h1/tagline unchanged. All 12 catalog brand display names match BRANDS names via case-insensitive lookup (incl. "VGOD Stig" → vgod-stig).
- Breadcrumbs: "Categories" → "Collections" (/collections) and category crumb → /collections/<slug>. Section heading "Details & documentation" → "Product details" with neutral copy ("Everything recorded for this item — expand a panel to read it."). Related heading "Related information & items" → "Related products" with marketplace copy ("Other products commonly viewed alongside <name> — from the same brand and collection."); /discover link kept. Description panel prototype note simplified to "Sample listing data. Prices in AED; checkout is a prototype."
- src/components/shared/item-card.tsx: the brand line above the product name (first element of the text block, paired with the nicotine chip row, parent gap-2 supplies spacing) restyled to the marketplace token: text-[0.68rem] font-medium uppercase tracking-[0.18em] text-violet-soft/90. No Link added (card root is already a Link — no nested anchors); price row, quick-add, saved button untouched.
- Checked product-order-actions.tsx / mobile-summary.tsx / variant-picker.tsx / product-save-button.tsx: zero references to warnings/conformity/compatibility/documents — no changes needed.
- Did NOT touch collections/**, brand/**, homepage/**, data/**, admin/** (parallel agents own those).
- Environment note: the auto dev server had been reaped by the sandbox (port 3000 dead, no process); restarted it detached via setsid (first nohup attempt died with transient EADDRINUSE) — server stable across sessions afterwards.
- Verification: tsc --noEmit → only pre-existing examples/ + skills/ template errors (src/ clean); bun run lint → 0 problems. curl: /products/elf-bar-bc5000 → 200 with "Safety warnings"=0, "Compatibility"=0, "Manufacturer"=0, "Safety information"=0 panels gone; "Compliance"=1 is the global FOOTER legal-nav link /compliance (identical count on untouched homepage — site chrome, not page content); chip renders href="/brand/elf-bar", "Elf Bar" present; Collections crumb + href="/collections/disposable-vapes"; "Product details" + "Related products" headings + "Sample listing data" note + card brand class all present. /products/al-fakher-crown-bar-pro-8000 and /products/vgod-cubano-60ml → 200, brand chips resolve to /brand/al-fakher and /brand/vgod-stig. dev.log clean (all 200s).

Stage Summary:
- Product pages are now pure marketplace listings: only Description / Specifications / FAQs remain, no compliance/safety/compatibility surfaces anywhere on the page, breadcrumbs point at the new /collections IA, and the brand is a glowing violet chip linking to /brand/<slug>.
- Catalog cards carry the same brand identity (violet-soft uppercase brand line above the name), so brand recognition is consistent from grid → product page → brand page.

Task ID: 16-b
Agent: Z.ai Code (fullstack)
Task: Reposition category URLs to /collections — new marketplace Collections index + detail pages, legacy /categories redirects, shared link sweep.

Work Log:
- Read worklog (foundation through 15) and the repositioned data foundation (catalog.ts: 5 categories w/ itemCount, 44 products; brands.ts: 12 brands; navigation.ts already pointing at /collections + /brand).
- /collections (NEW app/(site)/collections/page.tsx, server component): Breadcrumbs Home → Collections; NeonHeading (eyebrow "Marketplace", title "Shop the", accent "collections", ice duo accent — API learned from neon-heading.tsx: eyebrow/title/accent/tone/iceAccent) + sr-only h1 to keep heading semantics; intro copy about shopping by collection referencing the {CATALOG_ITEMS.length}-product range; responsive grid (1 / sm:2 / lg:3, gap-4→lg:6) of all 5 categories via the shared CategoryCard; wrapped in PageContainer inside a `relative` section host with SectionAtmosphere variant="violet" intensity={0.5} behind relative z-10 content; generateMetadata ("Collections" + marketplace description).
- /collections/[slug] (NEW page.tsx): copied the categories/[slug] pattern — generateStaticParams over CATALOG_CATEGORIES, generateMetadata with marketplace wording ("Browse N brand-name products in this collection — …", N computed from real items), Breadcrumbs Home → Collections → category.name, header eyebrow "Marketplace collection", h1, longDescription, AED-free meta chip row ("{n} products" + "Multiple brands" chips, min-h-9, border-line bg-elevated/45), CategorySortControl island, "Back to collections" pill link → /collections (min-h-11, ArrowLeft); SectionAtmosphere violet 0.45 host; notFound() on unknown slug.
- Sort control MOVED: categories/[slug]/sort-control.tsx recreated byte-for-byte as collections/[slug]/sort-control.tsx (its @/ alias imports needed no path changes; only doc-comment + aria-label/empty-copy wording switched to "collection"); imported from the new [slug]/page.tsx.
- Old routes deleted → replaced with minimal server-component redirects (redirect from "next/navigation"): categories/page.tsx → redirect("/collections"); categories/[slug]/page.tsx → async component awaiting params, redirect(`/collections/${slug}`). No other UI.
- Link sweep: shared category-card.tsx card Link href `/categories/…` → `/collections/…` (everything else untouched — this also fixes discover-view + homepage instances of the shared card); search-view.tsx popular chip hrefs → /collections/…, visible "Popular categories" → "Popular collections", empty-state copy "…brands and categories…" → "…brands and collections…"; discover-view.tsx "All categories" link → href="/collections" label "All collections".
- Grepped for stray /categories refs: remaining hits are only in files owned by others (homepage sections, products page — already updated by their agent, admin internals) and all resolve through the new 307 redirects.
- Ops note: dev server was reaped mid-session (port 3000 dead, curl 000). Restarted via `nohup bun run dev`; the supervisor's own restart raced it briefly (shared dev.log EADDRINUSE noise) before settling on one healthy instance.
- Verification: bunx tsc --noEmit — src/ clean (only pre-existing examples/ + skills/ template errors); bun run lint — 0 problems. HTTP: /collections 200, /collections/disposable-vapes 200, /collections/e-liquids 200, /collections/coils-accessories 200; /categories → 307 location /collections, /categories/e-liquids → 307 location /collections/e-liquids. HTML greps: /collections/disposable-vapes renders 12+ unique /products/* card links (31 real products, "Browse 31 brand-name" metadata), "Marketplace collection" eyebrow, chip row, "Back to collections"; /collections renders all 5 /collections/* card links + "Shop the collections" neon heading; /discover shows the /collections link with "All collections" and zero legacy hrefs; /search shows /collections chips + "Popular collections". dev.log: no compile errors after settle.

Stage Summary:
- Category browsing is now marketplace-native at /collections with legacy /categories URLs 307-redirecting (index + per-slug), so every pre-existing inbound link (homepage sections, product pages, old bookmarks) keeps working.
- Files created: app/(site)/collections/page.tsx, app/(site)/collections/[slug]/page.tsx, app/(site)/collections/[slug]/sort-control.tsx; recreated as redirects: app/(site)/categories/page.tsx, app/(site)/categories/[slug]/page.tsx.
- Files modified: components/shared/category-card.tsx, app/(site)/search/search-view.tsx, app/(site)/discover/discover-view.tsx. Files deleted: categories/[slug]/sort-control.tsx + old categories page bodies.
- TODO for later agents: consider redirect()-based rewrites in next.config if permanent 308s are ever wanted; homepage sections still say "Product categories" eyebrow (homepage agent's call).

Task ID: 16 (marketplace repositioning, orchestrator)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator) + 4 parallel subagents (16-b, 16-c, 16-d, 16-e)
Task: Reposition MIRAGE from a single vape brand into the UAE's multi-brand vapor marketplace — add 12 real brands with products, new URL structure (/collections/<category>, /brand/<brand>), strip safety/compliance blocks from product pages.

Work Log:
- 16-a (orchestrator): types/index.ts gained the Brand interface (slug/name/tagline/blurb/description/origin/established/accent/featured). New src/data/brands.ts — 12 brands (Al Fakher Vape, Elf Bar, Lost Mary, Geek Bar, Vozol Vape, Tugboat Vape, HQD Vape, Fummo Vape, Yuoto Vape, VGOD Stig, Maskking Vape, Silvaper Vape) with marketplace copy + accent colours. src/data/catalog.ts REWRITTEN — 43 products via a P() factory (auto id/sku, empty warnings/conformity/documents arrays to keep admin editor intact, ageRestricted auto by category, auto relatedSlugs = same brand then same category): 31 disposables, 4 pod systems (ELFA Pro, Wenax Q2, V-Mate E, Lost Mary 4-in-1), 3 e-liquids (Al Fakher Salt, VGOD Cubano 60ml, Silvaper Salt), 2 kits (VGOD Pro Mech 2, Wenax M2), 3 accessories (ELFA pods, Wenax coils, 4-in-1 pods). Real-style UAE pricing AED 25–349 with compareAtPrice on 8 items. Images reuse the generated product-art pool by device type. New src/services/brands.ts (brands/brand/brandItems/itemCounts); catalogService gained brandSlug filter + brand-aware suggest. navigation.ts: header/footer → Collections (/collections) + Brands (/brand). Fixed itemCount disposables 32→31; company-section stat 44→43.
- 16-b (full-stack-developer): /collections index (NeonHeading + 5 CategoryCards + violet atmosphere) and /collections/[slug] (static params, metadata, breadcrumbs, chips, moved sort-control island, back link). Old /categories and /categories/[slug] replaced with 307 redirects to /collections equivalents. category-card links → /collections/*; search-view + discover-view link/copy sweep ("Popular collections", "All collections"). Verified 200s + redirects.
- 16-c (full-stack-developer): new shared brand-card.tsx (accent-mapped neon tile, LED dot on featured, count chip) + rewritten /brand as "TWELVE BRANDS / ONE MARKETPLACE." directory over mixed atmosphere with 12 tiles + craft.jpg band. New /brand/[slug] landing: accent-glow h1, MARKETPLACE BRAND eyebrow, origin/est./count chips, description, "Products by …" ItemGrid, CTA row; generateStaticParams over BRANDS; unknown slugs 404.
- 16-d (full-stack-developer): product page stripped of Compatibility / Manufacturer / Safety information / Compliance & documents accordion panels AND the prominent Safety-warnings box; unused imports/constants removed; "Details & documentation" → "Product details"; breadcrumbs → Collections; brand label upgraded to LED chip linking /brand/<slug> (brandByName); related section re-headed "Related products"; honest prototype note simplified. item-card.tsx renders brand eyebrow above product name (span, not nested link). Order actions/summary verified free of compliance refs.
- 16-e (frontend-styling-expert): site-settings tagline/description → marketplace copy; hero → "EVERY BRAND." (neon-mix) / "ONE MARKETPLACE." (duo outline + flicker, data-text), marketplace lead + micro labels, CTAs "Shop the marketplace" (/discover) + "Browse brands" (/brand); brand-collection-section REBUILT as the Brand Wall (neon-edge panel kept; right side = 12 accent-tinted brand tiles with live counts → /brand/<slug>); product-categories chip → "All collections" /collections; collection-preview → "Trending NOW" + "View the full marketplace"; brand-intro → "The marketplace" eyebrow + marketplace story + "About the marketplace" chip; discover-section card → "All brands"; company-section stats (2021 / 12 brands / 43 products / UAE-wide); page metadata re-titled. Section order unchanged.
- Orchestrator browser E2E: homepage (hero data-text "One marketplace.", 12 /brand/* tiles, 9 /collections links, zero old copy), /brand → /brand/elf-bar (h1, chips Shenzhen/est. 2018/5 products, 5 product cards), /collections/disposable-vapes (31 products, brand eyebrows AL FAKHER VAPE / ELF BAR / LOST MARY, sort control), /categories/disposable-vapes → 307 → /collections/disposable-vapes, product page (0 safety/compatibility/compliance strings, brand chip → /brand/lost-mary, AED 95, flavours), E2E cart (Tugboat Evo 4500 Purple Rain AED 40 + AED 25 delivery = AED 65 with WhatsApp ordering intact), mobile 390 0px overflow with brand chips on cards. tsc clean for src/, lint 0 problems, no page errors.

Stage Summary:
- MIRAGE is now a true multi-brand marketplace: 12 brands × 43 products with real-style AED pricing, brand directory + landing pages at /brand/<slug>, collections at /collections/<slug> (old /categories 307-redirects), product pages reduced to Description/Specifications/FAQs + ordering (no safety/compatibility/manufacturer/compliance blocks), brand identity on every card and page, and homepage copy/tiles/sections fully repositioned — while the neon/smoke design system, ordering loop and WhatsApp checkout carry over untouched.

Task ID: 17
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator) + 3 parallel subagents (T17-b content, T17-c architecture, T17-d UX)
Task: Full-project audit and enterprise-grade optimization — line-by-line investigation of code structure, UX, UI, inconsistencies, gaps and content; SEO-friendly keyword-focused copy (LSI + semantic keywords) on every page; backend-ready frontend; full consistency sweep.

Work Log:
- AUDIT (4 parallel Explore agents, research-only): (1) SEO & metadata — no sitemap/manifest/canonicals/JSON-LD anywhere, robots.txt had no admin disallow, 24 admin pages + all utility routes crawlable+indexable, brand pages had title-template collisions ("…MIRAGE — MIRAGE") + thin descriptions, /categories redirects were 307s; semantic HTML near-perfect except missing h1 on one account route + h1→h3/h2→h4 skips. (2) Content — legacy single-brand story survived in /about (whole page = manufacturer copy), FAQ Devices/Liquids blocks (nonexistent products: Aura 700, Halo, Eclipse, SKU MSH-C5, MIR-YYMM batch codes), sample orders (brand "MIRAGE"), "the collection"/"pieces" cart+checkout+saved+404 copy, header search placeholder, dev-speak ("records", "batch-traceable", "Catalog" eyebrow), delivery-ETA conflict (1–2 vs 2–4 days), dead /support quick link, "5 Product families" stat, legal docs 100% placeholder, content.ts admin models legacy. (3) Code — 44 files bypassed services for data, 4 data domains had no service, 6 dead files (~2500 lines incl. dead prisma client + 3 atmosphere components), dead exports (8 motion variants, AuthScreenMode, Loadable, 5 service methods), `void X;` hacks, 4× duplicated featured-first comparator, no global-error/(site)/admin error boundaries, missing placeholder image, raw <img> in admin, tsc/lint safety nets documented. (4) UX — Checkbox had NO accessible name (blocked SR users at checkout age gate), primary button 3.93:1 contrast FAIL, focus-visible killed by focus:outline-none in 8 files, footer legal strip occluded by mobile bottom nav, 31-item collection grid unpaginated, h-9 touch targets, 18+ chip shown on accessories despite ageRestricted=false data, broken ARIA tabs in gallery.
- Wave 0 (orchestrator): created src/lib/seo.tsx (siteUrl/canonical helpers + JsonLd renderer + Organization/WebSite/Product+Offer/BreadcrumbList/FAQPage builders); src/app/sitemap.ts (75 URLs: 15 static + 5 collections + 12 brands + 43 products); src/app/robots.ts (Metadata API, Disallow /admin+/cart+/checkout+/saved+/account+/categories, absolute sitemap line); src/app/manifest.ts (PWA, #060409); root layout — keyword-rich default title "MIRAGE — Vape Marketplace UAE | Disposable Vapes, E-Liquids & Pod Systems", template `%s | MIRAGE`, 23 LSI keywords (brand+category), twitter images, site-wide Organization+WebSite JSON-LD; noindex sweep on 21 utility routes (cart/checkout/success/saved/search/all 12 account pages/offline/maintenance/session-expired/restricted) + admin layout noindex; permanentRedirect (308) on /categories stubs; canonicals on home/collections(+[slug])/brand(+[slug])/discover/products/[slug]; product pages Product+Offer+Breadcrumb JSON-LD + per-product keywords; brand pages rich descriptions + Breadcrumb JSON-LD; /help/faq FAQPage JSON-LD; hero h1 keyword sr-only extension; 18+ chip now conditional on item.ageRestricted (accessories clean); "Product details" intro enriched.
- T17-b (content agent): 21 files. /about FULLY rewritten as marketplace story (curates 12 brands from Dubai warehouse; stats 2021/12/43/UAE-wide; marketplace timeline; canonical). faqs.ts: 22 marketplace-voice Q&As (all 12 brands named, authenticity scratch-panel verification, 2–4 day delivery aligned, COD/card payment, 18+ Emirates-ID door check, faulty returns), zero nonexistent products. legal.ts: all 4 docs now substantive (Terms of Sale w/ 18+ & 7-day returns, PDPL privacy, cookies, consumer info w/ ESMA/ECAS). orders.ts: sample orders now real catalog products (MT15000, Crown Bar Pro 8000, Cubano, ELFA pods) w/ recomputed totals. content.ts admin models re-positioned. site-settings description deduped. "Catalog"→"Products" nav label. site-header search "Search vape brands and products…" + focus-visible fix + dead exports removed. Cart/checkout/saved/404: "collection/pieces" → "bag/products/marketplace". "over AED 200" → "AED 200 or more" (4 files). Homepage eyebrows/CTAs de-branded.
- T17-c (architecture agent): NEW services site-settings/navigation/legal/compliance (async, latency-simulated, documented) → service seam covers every data domain. NEW REST read API: /api/products(+brand/collection/q filters), /api/products/[slug], /api/brands(+counts), /api/collections, /api/search — force-static where safe. Wired dead services live: brand pages → brandsService, discover/search → catalogService.categories(), saved views → catalogService.itemsByIds(), account overview → accountService.getProfile() (+ /support→/help fix). Created lib/catalog-sort.ts (SortKey/SORT_OPTION_LIST/sortCatalogItems — one comparator everywhere incl. catalogService.items + brandsService.brandItems). Deleted: lib/db.ts, hero-visual/atmospheric-particles/ambient-lighting, 8 dead motion variants, AuthScreenMode+Loadable types, void hacks in admin-primitives. New boundaries: global-error.tsx, (site)/error.tsx, admin/error.tsx, loading.tsx ×4 (search/products/brand/collections). placeholder-missing.jpg created. FUTURE-BACKEND.md: "Data Access Patterns" contract (client→services / SSG build-time exception / API surface / swap recipe).
- T17-d (UX agent): Checkbox now aria-labelledby→visible label via useId (fixes checkout age gate for SR users) + FormField auto-wires hint/error aria-describedby (merge-dedupe helper). --primary token → #7c3aed (5.29:1 AA pass, was 3.93:1) leaving decorative --violet untouched. Footer pb-24 md:pb-10 (legal strip never occluded; verified on 390px) + aria-labels match visible headings. app-shell redundant padding removed. Collections island rebuilt: h-11 select, 6 sort options via catalog-sort, pagination 12/page with aria-current pager + "Showing X–Y of Z products" live region + reduced-motion-aware scroll-to-top. ItemCard p-5 + focus-visible ring. Gallery: ARIA tabs → aria-pressed buttons, focus rings, void hacks gone. Mobile nav dead icon map removed. Hero scroll indicator bottom-20 md:bottom-8 (clears bottom nav). MobileSummary md:hidden with safe-area-aware offset; product page padding rebalanced.
- Wave 2 (orchestrator): fixed leftovers (checkout.ts "collection bag" error copy, tickets.ts → Geek Bar Pulse X/Crown Bar/Cubano-era support threads, account.ts media alts rebranded). Verified end-to-end: tsc clean (src/), lint 0 problems, ALL 38 tested routes (public + 5 API) return 200, /categories → 308, robots.txt disallows correct, sitemap 75 URLs, manifest served, canonicals present, Product/Offer/BreadcrumbList/FAQPage/Organization/WebSite JSON-LD all in served HTML, noindex meta on cart/account, brand titles "Elf Bar UAE — 5 products in stock | MIRAGE" (no double-suffix), pagination live-tested (page 2 → "Showing 13–24 of 31 products", new products render), about page legacy-story grep = 0, /api/brands productCount sum = 43 = catalog truth, mobile 390px footer legal strip fully visible above bottom nav, desktop hero screenshot confirms neon design + darker accessible primary button, zero console errors.

Stage Summary:
- The storefront is now enterprise-grade on every audited axis: full technical SEO (sitemap/robots/manifest/canonicals/5 JSON-LD graph types/noindex policy/308s/pipe title template), marketplace-consistent SEO copy with LSI keywords across about/FAQ/legal/help/cart/checkout/404/header, complete service seam (17 services) + REST read API + documented backend-swap contract, zero dead code in lib/atmosphere/types, a11y pass (checkbox names, describedby wiring, AA contrast 5.29:1, focus-visible everywhere, footer geometry, pagination touch targets), and consistent "products/marketplace" voice with data-truthful counts everywhere.

Task ID: 18
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Rewrite the homepage for the renamed store — brand becomes VAPETIVE; hero H1 must be "#1 vape shop in UAE for instant online delivery"; no "marketplace" wording anywhere; no brand-count claims (no "12"/"twelve brands"); meaningful copy for every homepage section; homepage metadata/JSON-LD/chrome consistent with the new name.

Work Log:
- Brand rename at the settings layer: site-settings.ts → brandName "VAPETIVE", brandLegalName "Vapetive Trading L.L.C.", tagline "The UAE's #1 vape shop for instant online delivery", keyword-rich description (disposable vapes / pod systems / e-liquids / AED / age-verified UAE-wide delivery / same-day dispatch from Dubai), seo template "%s — VAPETIVE" + defaultDescription, contact emails → *@vapetive.example. Header logo, footer, JSON-LD and title template follow automatically.
- Root layout metadata: default title "Vapetive — #1 Vape Shop in UAE | Instant Vape Delivery Online"; keywords list de-marketplaced ("vape marketplace UAE" → "vape shop UAE", added "instant vape delivery UAE" + "same day vape delivery Dubai"), "MIRAGE" → "Vapetive". manifest.ts name/short_name/description → Vapetive.
- lib/seo.tsx: Organization (name VAPETIVE, legalName Vapetive Trading L.L.C., vapetive.ae-era description), WebSite (name VAPETIVE, alternateName "Vapetive — Vape Shop UAE"), Product Offer seller → VAPETIVE.
- Hero rewrite: H1 = "#1 Vape Shop in UAE" (lit neon-mix line) + "for instant online delivery" (hollow duo-outline flicker line) — exact required phrase, CSS uppercases; sr-only crawler extension "Vapetive — the UAE's #1 vape shop for instant online delivery of disposable vapes, pod systems and e-liquids."; eyebrow pill "UAE · DUBAI WAREHOUSE · ADULTS 18+"; lead paragraph (authentic disposables/pod kits/e-liquids, unit-checked, AED, dispatched the moment you order — no marketplace, no brand count); CTAs "Shop now" (/discover) + "Browse brands" (/brand); micro labels → "Instant UAE-wide delivery · 100% authentic stock · AED pricing · WhatsApp ordering"; aria-label "Vapetive assurances".
- Section rewrites: collection-preview → eyebrow "Featured vapes", CTA "Shop all vapes", NEW SEO subline (trending disposables/pod kits/e-liquids, authenticity-checked, same-day Dubai dispatch); product-categories → NEW subline (pocket-size disposables → refillable pod systems → bottled e-liquids); brand-collection (brand wall) → "TOP VAPE BRANDS. ONE SHOP." + copy naming brands without a count ("…and more"), aria-label "Vape brands stocked at Vapetive", per-brand product-count tiles kept (product counts ≠ brand counts); discover-section entries de-marketplaced ("Shop all vapes", "All brands — Explore the leading vape names we stock"); brand-intro → eyebrow "Why Vapetive", heading "ORDERED TODAY. AT YOUR DOOR.", two-paragraph same-day-dispatch/authenticity/WhatsApp promise, CTA "About Vapetive", image alt + fallback rebranded; company-section → stats (2021 / 100% authenticity / AED / UAE-wide — brand count + product count removed), copy "Vapetive Trading L.L.C. … What we list is what we stock"; support-section → "Real humans in Dubai, Sunday to Thursday — on WhatsApp, email or phone… answered the same business day".
- Homepage metadata: title "#1 Vape Shop in UAE for Instant Online Delivery" (renders "#1 Vape Shop in UAE for Instant Online Delivery | VAPETIVE" via template) + keyword-focused description.
- Consistency sweep for strings that surface on the homepage: services/whatsapp.ts (footer wa.me deep links) → "*VAPETIVE — Vapor order*", "Hi VAPETIVE!", vapetive.ae; not-found.tsx (ships in every page's RSC payload) → "Discover Vapetive" + "VAPETIVE — Dubai, United Arab Emirates"; mobile-navigation legal line → "Vapetive Trading L.L.C. · Dubai"; cart/checkout/saved empty states + cart/checkout/success/saved metadata de-marketplaced ("Discover Vapetive", "Browse the shop", "place your Vapetive order", etc.).
- Verification: lint 0 problems; served / has ZERO MIRAGE/marketplace/twelve/brand-count strings; title/description/OG/JSON-LD all VAPETIVE; agent-browser E2E — desktop 1440 hero (neon H1, smoke scene intact), products strip, collections, brand wall, discover, why-Vapetive, company, support + footer screenshots all correct; mobile 390px hero wraps cleanly with 0px horizontal overflow ("390 vs 390"); zero page errors / zero console errors; /discover + /brand still 200.

Stage Summary:
- The storefront is now VAPETIVE end-to-end on the homepage surface: settings-driven chrome, metadata, manifest, JSON-LD, WhatsApp composers and 404 boundary all carry the new name; hero carries the exact required H1; marketplace wording and brand-count claims are gone from every homepage-visible string (section copy, aria-labels, sr-only text, RSC payload).
- NOTE for next pass: interior page bodies (/brand directory copy, /about, /legal, admin shell) still contain legacy "MIRAGE/marketplace" strings — the homepage is clean because chrome/data flow from SITE_SETTINGS, but those page bodies need the same de-branding sweep (Task 17 continuation).

Task: Remove the search, cart, saved and profile icons from the top header on mobile devices.

Work Log:
- src/components/layout/site-header.tsx: deleted the mobile-only search icon link (its desktop inline search form is untouched); cart + saved icon links now `hidden … md:inline-flex`; removed the `sm:hidden` compact account icon; account pill moved `sm:inline-flex` → `md:inline-flex`. Net effect: below md (768px) the top bar renders logo + hamburger only, exactly mirroring the bottom navigation's visibility window (`md:hidden`).
- Reachability preserved (verified via agent-browser snapshot of the open sheet): Cart — bottom nav + sheet primary list; Saved — bottom nav + sheet "Saved items"; Account — bottom nav + sheet "Your account"; Search — sheet "Search" (Explore column). Desktop ≥md unchanged (search field, cart with badge, bookmark, Account pill).
- Verification: lint 0 problems; mobile 390px screenshot shows clean logo+hamburger bar; desktop 1440px screenshot unchanged; hamburger opens with full nav tree; zero page/console errors.

Stage Summary:
- Mobile users now get a decluttered header (logo + menu) with no duplicate entry points; all removed destinations remain one tap away via the bottom navigation or the menu sheet. Desktop experience untouched.

Task: "fix vapetive and mirage issue from the entire website" — purge every legacy MIRAGE/Mirage/mirage reference site-wide (the Task 18 note flagged interior page bodies), plus all leftover "marketplace" wording and brand-count claims so the whole site speaks VAPETIVE consistently.

Work Log:
- ENVIRONMENT RECOVERY: this session's /home/z/my-project was a bare scaffold; the real project (worklog through Task 18-b) survived at /tmp/my-project. Restored the full codebase into /home/z/my-project via rsync (package.json identical; node_modules reused), restarted the dev server on :3000.
- Audit: 77 Mirage occurrences across 35 src files + ~45 leftover "marketplace" strings + "twelve"/"All 12 Brands" count claims (about, discover, brand, collections/[slug], faqs, content.ts, brands.ts comment).
- Phase 1 (mechanical): legal name Mirage Vapor Trading L.L.C. → Vapetive Trading L.L.C.; emails *@mirage-vapor.example → *@vapetive.example (legal, content, compliance audit log ×8, admin users ×5, maintenance); localStorage keys mirage.cart.v1/mirage.orders.v1 → vapetive.cart.v1/vapetive.orders.v1.
- Phase 2 (context phrases): "the MIRAGE marketplace" → "the VAPETIVE shop"/"through VAPETIVE"/"on VAPETIVE" per sentence; eyebrows "Marketplace"/"Marketplace directory"/"Marketplace collection" → "Vapetive"/"Brand directory"/"Shop collection"; brand page chip "Marketplace brand" → "Stocked by VAPETIVE"; aria "Marketplace brands" → "Vape brands stocked at Vapetive"; checkout/saved/error copy "marketplace" → "shop"; nav descriptions → "Browse all vapes"/"Every brand we stock"; admin CMS models re-voiced ("Every brand. One shop.", "The shop", "The Vapetive standard").
- Brand-count purge: /brand heading "TWELVE BRANDS / ONE MARKETPLACE." → "TOP VAPE BRANDS / ONE SHOP." (matches homepage), title "All 12 Brands, One Marketplace" → "Every Brand We Stock"; about hero lead + who-we-are + timeline "twelve leading brands" → "the UAE's most-wanted brands"; about stat "12 Brands on the wall" → "100% Authenticity-checked stock" (aligns with homepage stat set); discover lead "twelve authentic brands" → "the UAE's leading vape brands"; collections/[slug] "from twelve authentic brands" → "from the UAE's leading vape brands"; FAQ "Twelve of the most requested brands" → "The most requested brands" (kept legit "twelve months" shelf-life and "Twelve thousand draws" puff copy).
- Phase 3: global MIRAGE → VAPETIVE for all remaining uppercase refs (types comments, data comments, globals.css tokens comment, admin shell/footer, theme editor, page-editor placeholder, global-error boundary, safety/compliance/contact/search/account metadata, maintenance, help, faqs, brand/[slug] JSON-LD description). Fixed one sed `&`-expansion glitch that garbled the /brand lead paragraph (restored exact sentence).
- Non-served files: README/docs(MOCK-FUNCTIONALITY, CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT, FUTURE-BACKEND)/scripts updated (wrangler names mirage-web/mirage/mirage-media/mirage-jobs → vapetive-*); worklog + tool-results kept as historical record.
- Verification: rg = 0 mirage / 0 marketplace / 0 illegitimate "twelve" in src; bun run lint 0 problems; 36 routes curl-checked — 0 mirage/marketplace hits in served HTML (incl. 404 payload, admin, offline/maintenance/restricted/session-expired); titles render correctly ("Terms of Sale | VAPETIVE", "Vape Brands UAE — Every Brand We Stock | VAPETIVE", "Our Story — About the UAE's Vape Shop | VAPETIVE", "Browse All Vape Products — Full Catalog | VAPETIVE"); agent-browser rendered-text sweep over 28 routes = 0 bad strings, 0 page errors; desktop 1440 screenshots (/ = correct title + hero, /brand = "TOP VAPE BRANDS ONE SHOP." + clean lead, /about = "The UAE's #1 vape shop" + rebranded copy + new stats); mobile 390px scrollWidth 390 vs 390 on / and /about, mobile header still logo+hamburger only.

Stage Summary:
- The brand rename is now complete at every layer: settings-driven chrome, homepage, ALL interior page bodies (about/brand/brand-slug/collections/collections-slug/discover/search/help/faq/legal/compliance/safety/contact/account/cart/checkout/saved/utility boundaries), admin shell + admin CMS data, JSON-LD, metadata, manifest, WhatsApp composers, localStorage keys, error/maintenance/offline boundaries — zero MIRAGE, zero "marketplace" wording, zero brand-count claims remain anywhere in the served site. 69 VAPETIVE / 44 Vapetive (legal-name & prose contexts) occurrences now define the voice.

Task ID: 20
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Slim the admin panel per user instruction — Content & Media keeps ONLY the Media library (delete Content hub, Pages list, Page editor, Navigation editor); Governance group removed entirely (Compliance centre, Legal documents); everything else stays.

Work Log:
- Dependency audit first: data/legal.ts + services/legal.ts (public /legal/*), data/compliance.ts + services/compliance.ts (public /compliance + admin.ts audit/users/roles), data/navigation.ts + services/navigation.ts (public header/footer/bottom nav) are all shared with the live storefront — kept. services/content.ts was consumed ONLY by the three deleted views → deleted. services/admin.ts is used by kept pages → reworked, not deleted.
- Deleted routes: src/app/admin/content/ (hub + pages + pages/[id] editor), src/app/admin/navigation/, src/app/admin/compliance/, src/app/admin/legal-documents/, and src/services/content.ts.
- admin-shell.tsx: "Content & media" group → "Media" (Media library only); Governance group removed; unused icon imports dropped (FileStack, LayoutList — ShieldCheck kept for Roles).
- services/admin.ts: AdminOverview reshaped { mediaAssets, catalogRecords, customers, orders, openTickets, recentActivity } — page-status counters (published/draft/review) and pendingComplianceReviews dropped; new customers/orders counts from ADMIN_CUSTOMERS/ORDER_SUMMARIES; orphaned compliance() method + COMPLIANCE_RECORDS/CONTENT_PAGES/ComplianceRecord/ContentPage imports removed.
- overview-view.tsx: stat row now 5 shop-relevant cards (Media assets 10 / Products in catalog 43 / Customers 8 / Orders 4 / Open tickets 3, skeleton matched); quick actions re-pointed to kept pages (Upload media, Manage products, Support inbox — was "New page" + "Review compliance" pointing at deleted routes); header subtitle de-governance'd. data/navigation.ts comment no longer cites /admin/navigation.
- Verification: rg = 0 dangling refs to /admin/content|/admin/navigation|/admin/compliance|/admin/legal-documents|services/content anywhere in src; lint 0 problems; routes — 14 kept admin URLs 200 (incl. catalog/products/[id] detail), all 5 removed URLs 404; agent-browser screenshots: /admin dashboard shows pruned sidebar (Overview/Media/Catalog/People/System), new stat cards + quick actions, VAPETIVE chrome; /admin/media fully functional (upload zone, filters, asset grid); 0 page errors, dev.log clean.

Stage Summary:
- Admin panel is now 14 routes: Dashboard, Media library, Products, Categories, Customers, Orders, Support, Theme, Settings, Users, Roles, Audit log (+2 detail routes). Content-management surface and Governance group are gone with zero dangling links, zero orphaned services, and a dashboard that now reports storefront truth (catalog/customers/orders/tickets) instead of page/compliance queues. Public /compliance + /legal/* pages unaffected (data layer shared, untouched).

Task: Remove the admin Theme page and reorder the admin sidebar into a logical order (Media must not sit at the top of the list).

Work Log:
- Reference check first: /admin/theme referenced ONLY by its own ADMIN_NAV entry (no cross-links from settings/overview); Palette icon used solely by the Theme entry.
- Deleted src/app/admin/theme/ (page.tsx + theme-view.tsx); removed the "Theme" nav entry + unused Palette import from admin-shell.tsx. Site-settings/theme tokens (SITE_SETTINGS, smoke presets) untouched — they power the public site, not the admin page.
- Sidebar reordered: Overview (Dashboard) → Catalog (Products, Categories) → Media (Media library) → People (Customers, Orders, Support) → System (Settings, Users, Roles, Audit log). Media now follows Catalog (product imagery context) instead of heading the list.
- Verification: rg = 0 refs to /admin/theme (the only "Palette" hit is shadcn's unrelated "Command Palette" title); lint 0 problems; routes — /admin, /admin/media, /admin/catalog/products, /admin/settings, /admin/users all 200, /admin/theme 404; agent-browser screenshot of /admin confirms the new group order with 0 page errors.

Stage Summary:
- Admin console is now 13 top-level routes (Dashboard, Media library, Products, Categories, Customers, Orders, Support, Settings, Users, Roles, Audit log + detail routes) with a business-logical sidebar flow: dashboard → catalog → media → people → system. Theme editor fully excised with zero dangling references.

Task: Add a Brands page to the admin panel.

Work Log:
- Studied existing admin patterns (categories-view DataTable/FormSection/Column primitives, Switch/Select/TextInput fields, ErrorState/EmptyState/PrototypeNotice, brandsService contract) before writing.
- NEW /admin/catalog/brands: page.tsx (metadata title "Brands") + brands-view.tsx (client). Loads brandsService.brands() + itemCounts() via Promise.all; DataTable with 7 columns — Brand (name + tagline subtitle), Slug (mono), Origin (origin + est.), Products (live count, sortable), Featured (in-memory Switch), Accent (dot + Select patch), Public page (internal Link to /brand/<slug>); sortable + initialSort name asc; responsive mobileCard variant; Add-brand FormSection (name/slug/accent, slug-regex validated, toast-confirmed, in-memory only) matching the categories add flow; skeleton/empty/error states included.
- admin-shell.tsx: "Brands" entry added to the Catalog group (Products, Categories, Brands) with BadgeCheck icon.
- Dashboard: adminService.overview() gained brands: BRANDS.length; overview-view.tsx adds a "Brands stocked" StatCard (6-card stat row, skeleton matched).
- Fixed a corrupted Tailwind arbitrary-value class suspicion in categories-view add-form — turned out the file already had the correct class (terminal display artifact), no change needed.
- Verification: lint 0 problems; /admin/catalog/brands, /admin, /admin/catalog/products all 200; agent-browser screenshot — sidebar shows Brands active in Catalog, table renders all 12 brands A→Z with taglines, origins/est., live product counts (Al Fakher 3, Elf Bar 5, Fummo 2, Geek Bar 5…), featured toggles, accent selects, View links; 0 page errors; dev.log clean.

Stage Summary:
- Brands are now first-class in the admin console: a dedicated /admin/catalog/brands management surface mirroring the categories UX (sort/toggle/patch/add-in-memory) with deep links to each brand's public storefront page, a sidebar entry in the Catalog group, and a "Brands stocked" KPI on the dashboard.

Task: "analyze and investigate the entire website and check for gaps, ux, ui, flow, code quality, arrangement and rest of everything including responsive, spacing between sections in different devices, scrolling and smoothness experience then fix them all" — full-site expert audit + fixes.

Work Log:
- AUDIT: 4 parallel Explore agents audited (a) storefront shop flow, (b) account/auth + info pages, (c) admin console, (d) global systems (css/layout/seo/motion/deps). Findings synthesized into a prioritized P0/P1/P2 fix plan.
- P0 FIX: /robots.txt returned HTTP 500 (public/robots.txt conflicted with app/robots.ts) — deleted the public stub; route now serves the real policy (Disallow /admin, /cart, /checkout, /account, /api + sitemap).
- SEO: removed wrongly-listed noindexed /search from sitemap.ts (74 clean URLs remain); manifest gained icon-192.png + maskable icon-512.png; layout icons gained apple-touch-icon (all 3 PNGs generated from logo.svg via sharp); Orbitron trimmed to the only-used 700 weight.
- GLOBAL CSS: Firefox scrollbar support (scrollbar-width/color on html); anchor offsets normalized (scroll-mt-28 → scroll-mt-24 everywhere — deliberately did NOT add scroll-padding-top, it would double-offset the existing scroll-mt system).
- OVERLAYS: dialog/alert-dialog/sheet overlays bumped z-50 → z-[60]/z-[70] so they always clear the site header + bottom nav; tooltips → z-[60].
- DEAD CODE PURGE: deleted 34 unused shadcn/ui components (48→14 kept), hooks/use-mobile.ts, tailwind.config.ts (v3-era, ignored by Tailwind v4), 4 abandoned atmosphere components (one with a broken import); pruned 40 unused deps from package.json (dnd-kit, mdxeditor, tanstack, recharts, embla, next-auth, next-intl, next-themes, sonner, z-ai-sdk, 15 radix pkgs…); removed dead lib/motion exports (transitions.page/springSoft) + dead ContentStatusBadge/CircleDashedIcon; tsconfig excludes examples/skills/mini-services so `tsc --noEmit` covers the app; REMOVED typescript.ignoreBuildErrors and re-enabled reactStrictMode in next.config — app now passes strict typecheck with zero errors.
- STOREFRONT: header/footer containers aligned max-w-7xl → max-w-6xl to match PageContainer (chrome/content drift above 1152px fixed); ItemCard/ProductSaveButton now subscribe to the shared saved-items store (toggles stay in sync everywhere); touch targets: card save/quick-add + cart remove/steppers + search clear + discover chips + faq chips + saved remove now 44px+ (invisible ::before hit-area expansion keeps visuals); catalog hub deleted (unreachable orphan); products page brand chip renders inert span instead of href="#" when brand missing; DiscoverSection spacing default → lg + pill "View all" CTA to match sibling sections; category-card uses shared revealViewport; discover sort h-9 → h-11; search inputs unified on pill radius; page-change scrolling shared via new scrollIntoViewSmooth() (reduced-motion aware); hero hides 4 lowest-opacity plumes below md (GPU relief); checkout success keys stable; NeonHeading eyebrow tracking normalized 0.24 → 0.22em; saved grid classes + loading states unified between /saved and /account/saved.
- ACCOUNT/AUTH: /account/verify orphan fixed — nav entry added (Fingerprint icon), register success CTA, overview quick-link (deduped double /help tile); preferences save failure now shows banner + toast (was silent); FAQ deep links (#device-setup) open the hashed panel and filter to its topic (was collapsed); InformationAccordion gained headingLevel (h2 on FAQ — outline fix), removed asChild that dropped the heading element; orders skeleton reshaped to rows; restricted/session-expired/maintenance internal <a> → next/link; maintenance mailto from SITE_SETTINGS; compliance h2s text-[1.2rem] → text-h3 + ISO dates via new shared lib/format (formatDate/formatDateTime en-AE Asia/Dubai); about stat computes CATALOG_ITEMS.length; forgot-password gained register link; security dead pwError wired into try/catch; contact form migrated to zod v4 pipe; passwordSchema + PASSWORD_HINT centralized in lib/validation (security/reset/register); footer copyright full contrast; legal template keys content-based.
- ADMIN: layoutId scoped per NavList variant (active pill no longer teleports between sidebar and drawer); drawer now opens LEFT matching the hamburger trigger + gained Radix DialogTitle/Description (same a11y fix applied to storefront mobile nav + item gallery — killed the "1 Issue" dev overlay); admin internal <a> → Link (orders, support, customer detail, order detail); 9 local date formatters (3 locales × 3 timezones) → shared lib/format everywhere incl. admin-primitives; orders Total sorts numerically not lexicographically; orphan /admin/catalog hub deleted; route-level loading.tsx added for all 4 detail routes; dashboard stat grid 6 cards → xl:grid-cols-3; search widths unified w-full lg:w-80; mobile card footers flex-wrap; media upload copy honest ("Browse files"); result-count copy unified ("Showing X …"); mock data regenerated for current IA (roles no longer cite content.*/theme.edit/legal.*, audit events no longer narrate deleted flows); products page gained eyebrow + "Add product" header CTA (prototype-honest toast); media gained eyebrow.
- FIX DONE DURING VERIFY: storefront mobile-nav drawer had a corrupted arbitrary class `w-in(24rem,92vw)]` → `w-[min(24rem,92vw)]` (drawer width was broken).
- VERIFY: bun run lint 0 problems; tsc --noEmit 0 errors (with ignoreBuildErrors removed); 48-route sweep — all 200 (deleted routes 404, /categories 308 redirect as designed, /robots.txt + /sitemap.xml 200); agent-browser: desktop 1440 home hero/footer (footer sticks, scrollW=vw), mobile 390 home + discover + cart (no overflow, quick-add → cart badge → qty stepper works), admin mobile drawer anchors left with correct group order + 0 dev-overlay issues, desktop admin dashboard (2×3 stats, regenerated activity), products/brands pages, FAQ hash opens panel scrolled into view, saved-state syncs card → product page via SPA nav; 0 page errors; dev.log clean.

Stage Summary:
- The site now passes strict TypeScript with build-error masking off, ships only used dependencies, serves a valid robots/sitemap/PWA icon set, has consistent spacing rhythm + container grid (6xl) across chrome and content, 44px+ touch targets on all core commerce controls, honest loading/error/empty states, an a11y-clean overlay system, and a coherent admin console (left drawer, variant-scoped active pill, shared date formatting, numeric sorts, current-IA mock data). Browser-verified end-to-end at 390/768/1440 with zero console errors.

Task: "plan the backend design, required apis, replacing static hardcoded data with dynamic data from backend, frontend backend sync, and rest of everything to make it fully functional ecommerce... deployed on cloudflare workers with d1, r2, kv... comprehensive, detail and enterprise grade implementation plan"

Work Log:
- AUDIT: mapped the full data layer — 11 static data files (43 products, 12 brands, 5 categories, 22 nav items, site settings, media, orders, tickets, compliance/roles/audit, legal, FAQs), all 17 service adapters (catalog, brands, navigation, settings, legal, compliance, account, saved-items, orderHistory, placedOrders, cart+useCart, checkout, support, media, admin, whatsapp), the 5 prototype read API routes, the zustand/sessionStorage client stores, 12 admin modules and ~30 public routes.
- Verified the architecture contract documented in docs/FUTURE-BACKEND.md ("service signatures are the contract") and docs/CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md (OpenNext recommendation, bindings sketch) — new plan builds directly on them.
- Gap findings logged (11 items) incl.: MIR- order reference prefix still live in checkoutService; fake saved-card label "•• 4021"; delivery fee constants client-side; unused Prisma scaffold; orphaned data/content.ts; client-authoritative pricing; hardcoded WhatsApp number; no session gating on /account.
- AUTHORED docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md (v1.0 planning baseline, 19 sections): design principles; current-state audit; Workers topology + binding map (D1/R2/KV/Queues/DO/Analytics Engine/Cron); FULL D1 schema (~40 tables, SQLite DDL: identity/auth/sessions, catalog+variants+specs+FTS5, carts/orders/payments/refunds/coupons/idempotency, media/navigation/legal/compliance/FAQs, RBAC/tickets/audit, privacy_requests) with derived-availability, inventory-reservation and money-in-fils rules; static-data→backend migration map + idempotent seeding strategy; R2 media pipeline (presigned upload → confirm → queue-processed variants, cdn-cgi image transforms, custom next/image loader); KV usage matrix + revalidation tag taxonomy; Queues/Cron/DO workloads; API conventions + ~70-endpoint catalog (public/cart/checkout/auth/account/admin/webhooks) with JSON contract samples and VD-YYYYMMDD order references; auth design (opaque sessions, argon2id hash-wasm + PBKDF2 fallback, Turnstile, CSRF, RBAC permission slugs); frontend-backend sync strategy (RSC→D1 repos vs client→/api/v1+TanStack Query, ISR+tag revalidation matrix, optimistic cart/saved stores, guest-cart merge, route protection); FTS5 search with synonyms + Analytics Engine loop; UAE payments (COD/mPOS first + Stripe AED webhooks); security & PDPL compliance (age-gate/Emirates-ID doorstep event, retention, export/deletion pipelines); observability/backups/DR (Time Travel, logpush, SLOs); codebase restructuring (drop Prisma → Drizzle, wrangler.jsonc, zod contracts, guard rules); 9-phase roadmap with acceptance criteria (≈57 engineer-days solo, ~6–7 weeks with 2 engineers); decision log (11 resolved decisions D1–D11) + risk register; appendices (wrangler.jsonc, zod contract sample, order state machine, definition of done).
- No production code changed in this task — pure planning deliverable; site untouched and still healthy (HTTP 200).

Stage Summary:
- docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md is now the enterprise-grade implementation baseline for the Cloudflare phase: every static data source has a mapped D1/KV/R2 destination with seed strategy, every service adapter has a swap path that preserves its signature (no UI rewrites), and the full API surface, schema, media pipeline, auth/RBAC, payments, caching, compliance and rollout plan are specified. Ready to begin Phase 0 (platform foundation) on request.

- All public server-rendered surfaces now read through repositories (D1/local SQLite). Remaining @/data consumers: 4 legacy service wrappers (to be deleted) + 6 admin pages (orchestrator scope, Task 25-a).

Task ID: 25
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator; 25-b subagent for (site) conversions)
Task: "start implementing backend as planned, analyze and apply everything accordingly without making any mistakes" — implement the Cloudflare-portable backend per docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md.

Work Log:
- STAGE A (foundation): migrations/0001_init.sql — full 40-table schema (identity/sessions/RBAC, catalog+variants+specs+FTS5 external-content index+triggers, carts/orders/order_items/order_events/payments, media/nav/legal/compliance/FAQs, audit, kv_store+job_queue+counters locals). Runtime-adaptive SQLite driver (node:sqlite under Node 24 dev, bun:sqlite under Bun tooling) behind an async DbClient with a D1 driver (globalThis.__VAPETIVE_D1__) for Workers — identical repos on both. Core libs: env/secrets, ULID ids, money-in-fils, PBKDF2-SHA256-600k (PHC format, WebCrypto), signed opaque sessions (sha256-stored, HMAC cookies), RBAC (5 seeded roles/16 permissions), audit trail, in-process rate limiter, KV abstraction (Workers KV or kv_store), job outbox (Resend when key present), Turnstile helper.
- SEED (scripts/seed.ts, idempotent, `bun run db:seed`): full import of the typed mocks — 43 products (+images/variants/specs/faqs/docs/related/FTS), 12 brands, 5 categories, 18 media rows, 22 nav items, site/delivery/feature settings (KV), 4 legal docs+sections, compliance records, 22 FAQs, RBAC, admin account + 4 demo customers, 3 demo orders with events/payments/age-verification, 5 tickets, audit events. Demo stock policy: 2 low-stock + 1 out-of-stock to exercise all availability states. Admin credentials: admin@vapetive.example / Admin#Vapetive2025 (env-overridable).
- STAGE B (API): withApi guard (zod validation → 422 field map, same-origin CSRF, rate limits, session+RBAC resolution, error envelope, request ids) + 41 route handlers under /api/v1 (catalog/search/suggest/categories/brands, faqs/legal/compliance, site settings/nav/config, contact→ticket+email job, newsletter, auth register/sign-in/sign-out/session/forgot/reset/verify, cart (server-authoritative, signed guest cookie, merge-on-sign-in), checkout quote/orders (idempotency keys, conditional-UPDATE inventory reservation, VD-YYYYMMDD-NNNNNN references — kills the MIR- leftover), account me/preferences/saved/sessions/orders/privacy, admin overview/products/orders+events/customers/tickets+reply/media+upload/audit/settings/users) + Stripe webhook (HMAC-verified) + legacy /api/* rewritten onto repos.
- BUGS CAUGHT BY VERIFICATION (fixed): FTS external-content join (no product_id column — rowid join), idempotency replay after cart conversion (replay probe moved before cart resolution, hash over body), transitionOrder duplicate UPDATE, order_items ORDER BY created_at (no column → rowid), /admin/roles SSR self-fetch (server pages now call repos), stale tsbuildinfo masking (cache purged; fresh tsc clean).
- STAGE C (sync): client services rewritten to /api/v1 (catalog/brands/admin/media/support/orderHistory fetch clients; cart store = optimistic + reconcile + server hydration; checkout posts with idempotency key + age flag; account service real + useAuth store; saved items sync for signed-in users; WhatsApp number settings-driven). AppBootstrap provider hydrates auth/cart/saved/config per load. src/server/data.ts facade + full conversion of ~30 server pages/components off @/data (Task 25-b subagent; verified zero @/data refs in scope). 4 dead mock-service wrappers deleted. Admin: server-side staff gate on /admin (307 verified), account ownership gates on protected /account pages, settings editor saves via PATCH (KV + revision history), product editor persists name/tagline/description/model/price/flags/publish/stock (+FTS refresh), order status transitions UI (state machine, audited), contact form → real tickets, order detail/customer attribution now REAL (own orders/tickets).
- HONESTY PASS: removed mock claims — admin dashboard/footer/banner, cart persistence notice, checkout "saved card •• 4021" removed (COD + mPOS only until Stripe keys), success-copy updates, integration panel now reflects connected D1/KV/auth + local-mode R2.
- VERIFY: tsc --noEmit 0 errors (fresh cache); eslint 0/0; 48-route public sweep + 14 admin pages + 8 admin APIs + 7 account pages all 200 (307s for anonymous gates as designed); curl e2e: register→sign-in→session→saved toggle→product patch→contact ticket; cart→quote→COD order→idempotent replay→inventory reservation (40/2 reserved)→cancel releases; agent-browser desktop 1440 + mobile 390: home, PDP variant-select→add-to-cart→badge→cart, checkout form→age confirm→REAL order VD-20261020-000003→success page, sign-in→admin dashboard live KPIs→order transition processing→packed via UI (persisted, audited); 0 console errors. Two OOM kills of next-server by the sandbox under recompile churn (environment, not code — restarted clean).

Stage Summary:
- The storefront now runs on a real backend: D1-shaped database (local SQLite now, same SQL/DSN on Cloudflare via binding injection), server-authoritative cart/pricing/inventory, real auth+RBAC, real orders with COD/mPOS, audited admin operations, media upload pipeline, transactional-email outbox, and a versioned /api/v1 surface — with every UI contract preserved (zero view rewrites). Deployment to Workers = OpenNext adapter + binding injection + R2/Queue consumers (documented in docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md §16); no app-code changes expected.

Task ID: 26 (orchestrator)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: "run enterprise qa audit all over the website including frontend, backend, ui, ux, db, logic, account and user access, crud, code structure, file name and orientation, and rest of all the aspects and fix everything step by step, make sure all they're optimized, maintain best practices, enterprise grade, and ready to deploy"

Work Log:
- STATE: verified Task 25/25-b delivered the full backend (40-table schema, repos, 55 routes, real auth/RBAC); Task 21 verified (theme route gone, ADMIN_NAV ordered Dashboard->Catalog->Media->People->System).
- AUDIT: launched three independent read-only auditors in parallel (26-a frontend/UX/SEO/a11y, 26-b backend/security/DB/logic, 26-c structure/dead-code/naming) with file:line evidence + live HTTP probes. Consolidated verdict into docs/QA-AUDIT.md: 7 P0 (false prototype-copy cluster), 21 P1 (backend integrity + broken admin routes + unwired flows), ~30 P2, ~20 P3; verified-clean list (injection, crypto, RBAC map, oversell, idempotency, a11y).
- BACKEND P1 FIXES (orchestrator): orders repo rework — single all-or-nothing batch for checkout (order+address+events+items+payment+coupon redemption+cart conversion; no partial orders), reservation release on delivered (qty_on_hand decrement; fixes permanent stock erosion), COD settles to paid+captured on delivery, atomic RETURNING order references, optimistic-concurrency transitions (WHERE status AND version), coupon engine (percent/fixed/free_delivery, windows, min-spend, global+per-user redemption limits) + quote-preview endpoint + 422 handling, variant price_delta honored end-to-end, N+1 order lists replaced by window-function aggregates, IN-list chunking to 90 (D1 bind cap), availability pre-check.
- SECURITY FIXES: session-revoke IDOR closed (ownership-scoped revokeOwnedSession), rate-limit keying de-spoofed (cf-connecting-ip first; public XFF ignored), Stripe webhook fails closed in production + timing-safe signature compare + no orphan order_events, verify-email resend throttled, forgot-password devToken gated to development, staff-target guard on customer suspend, sort-key whitelist (?sort=bogus was a reproduced 500), emirate whitelist at checkout, security headers (nosniff/XFO/HSTS/Referrer-Policy/Permissions-Policy/COOP), 256KB default body cap with media-upload override, CSRF sec-fetch-site fallback, edge middleware gate for /account + /admin (hard 307, restores correct status after the (site) loading skeleton softened in-page redirects), prod boot guard for SESSION_SIGNING_KEY, sliding session expiry with absolute cap, constant-time cookie-MAC compare, register duplicate-email race mapped to 409.
- INFRASTRUCTURE: migrations/0002_hardening.sql (21 missing FK/hot indexes + job lease column, applied via the tracked migrations runner); src/server/maintenance.ts sweep (stuck-job requeue via leased_at, expired sessions/reset/verify tokens, idempotency keys, abandoned carts) triggered lazily from the API guard (Cron-ready for Workers); ticket reply route implemented (was 404 — supportService.reply dead); media upload POST implemented (was 405 — multipart, sanitized names, R2-or-local storage, media_assets row); admin ticket-detail view fully wired (reply/notes/status/priority now save + refresh).
- HONESTY PASS (26-d + 26-e subagents): 63 files de-prototyped — every false "prototype/mock/nothing stored/simulated" claim removed or rewritten across storefront, account, checkout, success, contact, compliance, legal, admin views; live KV complianceNotice corrected + re-seeded; PrototypeNotice repurposed; password-reset view wired to the live API; security-view session revocation wired; account-nav fake persona replaced with a sign-in prompt; blue #2563eb swatch replaced.
- STRUCTURE (26-c list executed): deleted src/lib/db.ts (Prisma), prisma/, db/custom.db, src/data/{content,orders}.ts, dead data/account exports + orphan types, 6 unused shadcn primitives, empty dirs; deps pruned (@prisma/client, prisma, radix toggle/label/separator; sharp -> devDeps); package.json renamed vapetive + typecheck script; sitemap now DB-driven with real updated_at; duplicate order-formatter merged into lib/format; README rewritten for the full-stack reality; MOCK-FUNCTIONALITY/FUTURE-BACKEND marked historical; .env.example added; .gitignore + git untracks (runtime DB, tool-results, upload/download/agent-ctx); canonicals added to 7 content pages; (site) loading skeleton; FilterBar touch targets 44px; 404 skip-link target; global-error digest-only; noImplicitAny enabled (tsc clean).
- SEED: complianceNotice corrected, Arctic Ice swatch, two demo coupons (WELCOME10 10% min AED 100 per-user-1; AED20OFF fixed AED 20 min AED 200 limit 500); re-seeded idempotently.
- VERIFY: bunx tsc --noEmit 0 errors (with noImplicitAny: true); eslint 0/0; 31-route public sweep all 200 (+ 404 branded, robots/sitemap/manifest 200); middleware gates: /account + /account/orders + /admin 307 anonymous, 200 signed-in, public account paths stay 200; security headers present live; API e2e: guest cart -> quote (plain AED 698 free-delivery) -> coupon quote (WELCOME10 -69.80 -> 628.20) -> bogus coupon rejected -> COD order VD-20261020-000004 created -> idempotent replay same ref -> admin transitions packed->shipped->delivered -> inventory 40/0 -> 38/0 (reservation released, payment captured, coupon redemption + age-verification rows written) -> illegal transition 409 -> session-revoke IDOR regression confirmed closed; ticket reply + media upload (file persisted to public/uploads/qa + DB row) verified; admin UI sign-in -> live dashboard (KPIs, audit trail shows QA session); browser golden paths at 1440 + 390: home/PDP variant->add-to-cart->badge->cart->checkout form->age confirm->REAL order VD-20261020-000005->honest success copy; zero console errors; prototype-copy live scan negative on all surfaces; mobile 390 no horizontal overflow. Two sandbox OOM restarts of next-server under recompile churn (environment, not code).

Stage Summary:
- The site now passes an independent three-auditor enterprise QA across frontend, backend, DB, logic, auth/access, CRUD, structure and naming — with every P0 and P1 fixed and verified end-to-end: transactional checkout with coupons, correct inventory accounting through delivery, hardened auth/rate limits/webhook, working admin support + media upload, honest UI copy everywhere, DB-driven sitemap, pruned dependencies, clean strict-types build, and a documented pre-launch deployment checklist in docs/QA-AUDIT.md. Remaining known items are deliberately documented, not hidden: coupon UI input in checkout (backend + quote API ready), TanStack Query adoption, nonce-based CSP, and Cloudflare R2/Queue/Cron wiring at deploy time.

Task ID: 26-a
Agent: Explore (frontend auditor)
Task: READ-ONLY enterprise frontend/UI/UX/SEO/a11y audit of the VAPETIVE storefront ((site) pages, layouts, shared/homepage/account/legal/atmosphere components, SEO files, hydration, links, copy) with live curl evidence; no files modified.

Work Log:
- Read worklog Task 25 section only (lines 574-589) for architecture context; audited 40+ (site) pages/views, all layout/shared/homepage/account/legal/atmosphere components, forms/fields, services hydration layer, seo/sitemap/robots/manifest.
- Brand greps clean: zero MIRAGE/Mirage/mirage, zero "marketplace", zero blue/indigo Tailwind classes or CSS; one data-level blue swatch (#2563eb "Ocean Blue") found in src/data/catalog.ts:927 and flagged; single "MIR-" remnant is an explanatory comment in server/repos/orders.ts:12.
- SEO verified: metadataBase/OG/Twitter/JSON-LD (Organization, WebSite+SearchAction, Product/Offer, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage live-confirmed), robots.txt correct (admin/account/api disallowed, live-checked), manifest icons present; gaps: sitemap reads static mocks not the DB (matches today, 43=43), missing canonical on compliance/safety/contact/legal pages.
- States verified: error boundaries complete; empty states present for search/discover/cart/saved/orders; skeletons good; loading.tsx missing on home/collections index/help-faq/about/compliance/contact/legal.
- Layout/responsive verified: sticky-footer pattern correct (min-h-screen flex + flex-1 + mt-auto), max-w-6xl consistent, bottom-nav offsets + PDP pb-28 + MobileSummary safe-area math correct, add-to-cart/checkout >=48px; FilterBar chips 36px flagged.
- A11y verified strong: alt text, FormField aria wiring, aria-current on all navs, one h1/page (HTML-verified), Radix focus traps, focus-visible, ~7.6:1 muted contrast, prefers-reduced-motion honored in CSS + JS; two P2s (search suggestions combobox semantics, 404 skip-link target).
- Hydration grep clean: no window/localStorage during initial render; hydrated-flag pattern + useSyncExternalStore greeting; Date.now/Math.random only in event-handler idempotency key.
- Links verified: all internal hrefs resolve, DB nav hrefs checked via API, all target=_blank carry rel=noopener noreferrer, wa.me/tel/mailto correct.
- Copy audit (the big cluster): PrototypeNotice + "prototype/sample/mock" wording is still user-visible on ~15 public surfaces — footer complianceNotice (live KV value, HTML-verified), PDP accordion, checkout, success, contact success, compliance (age-gate copy wrong), all account pages incl. real-session-gated ones, legal template, about/safety/homepage company section, orders/saved — contradicting the real backend delivered in Task 25.
- Functional gaps found: reset-password view not wired to existing /api/v1/auth/reset-password; security page never calls revokeSession/revokeOtherSessions; sign-in "Remember this device" checkbox inert; preferences ar-AE copy wrong (PATCH persists).
- Perf notes: client-catalog mirror downloads the full catalog before cart resolves; homepage sections are all client components; duplicate date formatter; hardcoded AED-200 threshold in checkout.
- Route probes: 25/25 expected results — all listed routes 200, /categories 308 (by design), /nonexistent-page 404, /account 307 anonymous (gate works), PDP 200 for real slug al-fakher-salt-30ml.
- No TODO/FIXME; console.* only in error boundaries/server logs; global-error leaks raw error.message (P3).

Stage Summary:
- Storefront engineering quality is high (a11y, motion system, state handling, form semantics all above bar), but the UI still narrates the pre-Task-25 prototype: ~15 user-visible "prototype/sample/nothing is persisted" claims are now factually false against the live backend, headlined by the site-wide footer complianceNotice (P0, live-verified in served HTML) and wrong legal-age copy on /compliance. Two real functional gaps (password reset unwired, session revoke faked) and a static (not DB-driven) sitemap complete the P1 set. Fix list: 7 P0 copy corrections + seed/KV settings update, 10 P1 copy/flow fixes, plus small P2/P3 polish (FilterBar touch targets, search combobox, canonicals, catalog mirror payload).

Task ID: 26-b
Agent: Explore (backend auditor)
Task: READ-ONLY enterprise backend/security/database/business-logic audit of the VAPETIVE backend (repos, 55 routes, schema, auth/RBAC, checkout/inventory, webhook, jobs, client sync). No files modified; GET-only probes for evidence.

Work Log:
- Verified architecture claims from Task 25: parameterized SQL throughout, PBKDF2-600k + sha256-stored 256-bit sessions with signed httpOnly cookies, server-side /admin gate, conditional-UPDATE inventory reservation, idempotent checkout replay before cart resolution, FTS5 external-content index correctness, and anonymous probes: /auth/session 200 (null user), /admin/* 401, /account/orders 401, /checkout/orders/VD-... 401 (guests CANNOT read orders), /catalog/products + /faqs + /site/settings 200 (no secret leakage), legacy /api/products 200, webhook GET 405. Origin-mismatch POST -> 403 (but no-Origin POST passes — guard only checks Origin when present).
- FINDINGS (0xP0, 8xP1, ~24xP2): P1s — (1) delivered orders never release qty_reserved -> permanent stock erosion (orders.ts:803-825); (2) DELETE /api/v1/account/sessions?id revokes ARBITRARY users' sessions — IDOR (route:22-27); (3) checkout multi-write not a single transaction -> partial orders on crash (orders.ts:234-391); (4) rate limits keyed on spoofable x-forwarded-for (auth-context.ts:40-47); (5) Stripe webhook fails open when STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET unset (webhook:17-32, plus provider_ref never written so happy-path unreachable); (6) couponCode accepted by zod but never applied/redeemed (checkout route:29); (7) /auth/verify-email resend unauthenticated with NO rate limit/Turnstile -> email bombing; (8) zero security headers in next.config. Broken wiring: supportService.reply -> /admin/tickets/:id/reply 404 (route absent); mediaService.upload -> POST /admin/media 405 (GET-only route) — both repo functions orphaned. P2 highlights: maintenance flag stored but never enforced anywhere; order/ticket reference generation increment+select race (use RETURNING); addLine read-then-write unique-violation race (use UPSERT); compareAt<price zod gap -> CHECK violation 500; ?sort=bogus -> 500 (SORT_SQL unvalidated cast — reproduced); forgot-password devToken leaks reset token in non-prod (enumeration+takeover on preview); suspended super-admin via customers.manage (no staff-target guard); admin pages gated by isStaff only (API 403s saves, UI exposed); N+1 in order lists and listTickets (loads ALL messages); missing FK indexes (payments.order_id, ticket_messages.ticket_id, user_addresses.user_id, order_addresses.order_id, coupon_redemptions...); no cleanup of expired sessions/carts/idempotency keys/tokens; stuck 'processing' jobs never requeued; D1 100-param bind limit will break >90-line carts in hydrate/getProductsBySlugs; variant price_delta_cents ignored in pricing (trap); SESSION_ABSOLUTE_MS unused (no sliding/absolute expiry); HMAC compares non-constant-time; Prisma stack dead (lib/db.ts, prisma/, deps, scripts) — zero importers; .env tracked in git; stale prototype copy in checkout/support/order-detail contradicts the real backend.
- Full report delivered: findings grouped by checklist 1-14 with file:line, ADMIN ROUTE x PERMISSION map (15 API routes x RBAC verified), "routes lacking zod validation" list (11), Top-10-by-impact, concrete fixes per finding.

Stage Summary:
- Backend is genuinely solid on the essentials (SQL safety, password/session crypto, RBAC on every admin route, oversell protection, idempotency, guest-order access control) — no injection, no auth bypass, no PII/hash leakage found. The P1 cluster is concentrated in (a) inventory accounting after delivery, (b) one un-scoped session-revoke endpoint, (c) transactionality of the checkout write, (d) rate-limit keying, (e) webhook fail-open, and (f) two client-called routes that were never implemented (support reply, media upload). Recommended fix order: session DELETE ownership (1-line) -> delivered reservation release -> single-batch checkout -> webhook fail-closed + verify-email rate limit -> security headers -> reference RETURNING + addLine UPSERT -> implement/remove the two broken client calls -> maintenance enforcement.

Task ID: 26-c
Agent: Explore (structure auditor)
Task: READ-ONLY enterprise audit — structure/quality/naming/dead-code (very thorough).

Work Log:
- Import maps built for src/data/* and src/services/* by grepping all src/, scripts/, config (incl. relative imports). PROVEN DEAD (zero importers): src/data/content.ts, src/data/orders.ts, src/services/support.ts (adminService.tickets covers it), src/lib/db.ts (Prisma), 6 shadcn primitives (ui/toggle|input|sheet|label|skeleton|separator.tsx), MOCK_USER/MOCK_PREFERENCES/MOCK_SESSIONS exports, types ContentPage/ContentSection. Kept-with-caveat: data/{navigation,legal,compliance,tickets,account}.ts = seed-only contract; data/{catalog,brands,site-settings}.ts = seed+sitemap/layout.
- Myths busted: db:seed:reset --reset IS implemented (seed.ts:33); type hygiene excellent (0 real ": any", 0 as-any, 0 ts-ignore, 0 TODOs, 0 debugger; only 1 false-positive match in a comment); lint 0/0; curl sweep all healthy (/ 200, /api/v1 200s, /admin 307 gate, protected APIs 401); all public/ assets referenced; kebab-case 100% clean; money formatting single-sourced; no other dead components (neon-divider/smoke-texture/motion-boundary verified alive via relative imports).
- P1s found: db/*.db + 4MB WAL tracked in git (no gitignore entry); PrototypeNotice's "mock data, nothing is stored" copy rendered on 28 now-real screens; stale Prisma layer (lib/db.ts + prisma/ + db/custom.db + 2 deps + 4 npm scripts + .env DATABASE_URL trap); dead data/service files; README + MOCK-FUNCTIONALITY.md describe frontend-only MIRAGE era; .env.example missing.
- P2s: order-format.ts duplicates lib/format.ts date formatter (3 importers to re-point); placed-orders/session-storage stale "prototype/future D1" docstrings; password rules duplicated client (lib/validation.ts) vs server (register route); tsconfig noImplicitAny:false under strict:true; eslint 30+ rules globally off; next.config lacks security headers; package.json name = scaffold, sharp in deps (only used by scripts/smoke-keying.ts), bun-types unwired; tool-results/ (~9.6MB) + upload/ + agent-ctx/ + examples/ + tests/ tracked; FUTURE-BACKEND.md vs BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md overlap.
- P3s: dead CSS (text-neon-outline-red, hairline-t, safe-bottom, mask-fade-*, no-print, sidebar+chart token blocks); empty dirs src/server/jobs/ and api/v1/account/sessions/[id]/; <img> in admin order-detail-view:34; dev-keeper.sh/generate-images.sh/smoke-src sandbox tooling undocumented.
- Verification: bun run lint once -> 0 errors 0 warnings. No files modified; no install/build/dev/tsc run.

Stage Summary:
- Structure is in strong shape post-backend (naming clean, type hygiene excellent, components fully wired); the debt is concentrated in un-executed cleanup the project's own docs already prescribe (Prisma removal, content.ts deletion), false "prototype" messaging, stale MIRAGE-era docs, and git hygiene (tracked DB + tool screenshots). Ready-to-execute SAFE DELETION LIST (10 items) and LOW-RISK RENAMES list delivered in audit report; all dead-code claims grep-proven against src/ + scripts/.

Task ID: 26-d
Agent: general-purpose (copy-honesty fixer)
Task: "Fix false prototype copy sitewide" — make every UI surface tell the truth about the live Task 25 backend.

Work Log:
- COMPONENT: prototype-notice.tsx default copy rewritten to honest store notice ("Live storefront — real inventory, real accounts, real orders... 18+ only"); compact variant now renders children (was hard-coded "Prototype"); props API unchanged; doc comment updated. All 28 usages grepped; in-scope usages with false custom text fixed.
- CHECKOUT/SUCCESS: checkout-view leads + notice + payment footnote now describe real orders (stock reserved, VD- reference, team alerted; COD/mPOS; "no online card charge today"; "your order reference is your confirmation"); success-view says orders are stored server-side with unique VD- reference, payment collected on delivery, on-screen confirmation session-scoped for guests only.
- FORMS: contact-form toast/success = message received + ticket created (true: POST /api/v1/contact), error no longer claims prototype; register/profile/overview/saved/privacy/preferences views stripped of "prototype/nothing stored/not persisted/mock adapter" claims; account-page banner -> slim true notice ("encrypted sessions, 18+ rules").
- ORDERS: order history page/view/detail reworded to real orders (unique VD- reference, payment on delivery); "demo orders from our launch dataset may appear below" allowed on list page only; SampleOrderRow->HistoryOrderRow + sampleCount->serverCount (logic unchanged).
- WIRING: reset-password-view now reads ?token (Suspense added in page), validates via lib/validation passwordSchema, calls accountService.resetPassword({token,password}), toast + redirect to /account/sign-in, honest errors; fake latency + "no password was changed" simulation deleted. security-view wired to revokeSession(id)/revokeOtherSessions() with list refresh + honest toasts; password section reworded ("rolling out with email verification — contact support"), MFA marked planned. sign-in inert "Remember this device" checkbox removed (30-day cookie is automatic), true note added.
- METADATA: 12 page descriptions rewritten (cart, saved, checkout, sign-in, register, profile, security, privacy, preferences, reset-password, forgot-password, orders) + false on-page leads fixed; no email/SMS promises anywhere (job outbox may not send without RESEND key).
- JARGON/DISCLAIMERS: variant-picker "single configuration"/"Product options"; content-card "Document available on request"; restricted page de-"prototype"d; brand page loses {brands.length} count + "sample imagery pending"; legal template "Placeholder wording" footer removed; company/about/safety "pending client verification"/"before launch" disclaimers removed (+ unused imports).
- SWEEP: grep -i "prototype|mock|simulat|sample |not persisted|not be sent|no backend" over (site)/components/admin -> fixed extra in-scope stragglers: help/faq/faqs.ts (4 false answers), account/page.tsx lead, forgot-password-view subtitle, admin-shell banner + notification labels, admin/support queue copy; 3 stale code comments updated. Remaining hits justified: PrototypeNotice identifier (backward-compat name, not copy), contact-form error string (true), faq "null-prototype" (JS term).
- FLAGGED (out of scope, untouched): account-nav PROTOTYPE_PERSONA fallback (fixed later by orchestrator); admin views other than support-view still carried stale copy (fixed by 26-e).
- VERIFY: bun run lint (eslint .) -> 0 errors / 0 warnings; no build/dev/tsc per instructions; removed-import grep clean.

Stage Summary:
- Every customer-facing surface in scope now states the live truth: real inventory/orders with VD- references, COD/card-on-delivery with door-step Emirates ID checks, real accounts/sessions/preferences/saved-items sync, real contact tickets and privacy requests — with zero "prototype/mock/nothing stored" claims remaining in (site) + components copy. Reset-password and session revocation are now actually wired to /api/v1.

Task ID: 26-e
Agent: general-purpose (admin copy fixer)
Task: Make every admin *-view.tsx tell the truth post-backend-live — remove stale MIRAGE-era "mock/prototype/simulated/nothing persists" copy (copy + comments only, no logic/JSX-structure changes).

Work Log:
- Verified endpoints before claiming persistence: product PATCH (editor really calls /api/v1/admin/products/:id), order events POST (audited state machine), settings PATCH (tagline+contact only -> copy scoped to exactly that), tickets PATCH + reply POST exist but ticket-detail handlers were in-view stubs (wired by the orchestrator afterwards); customers/[id] PATCH (suspend) exists but the view handler is a stub; NO POST /admin/products, NO categories/brands mutation, NO media upload POST (route.ts = GET only) or media PATCH, NO audit export, NO users invite -> those actions described as "not wired into this console yet", never as saving, never as "mock/prototype".
- 15 files rewritten to staff-console voice (en-AE, no blue/indigo): customers list+detail, products list+editor, categories, brands, orders list+detail, roles, users, settings, audit-log, ticket-detail, media-library, error.tsx. overview-view.tsx and support-view.tsx verified clean, untouched.
- Truth restored where false: product editor "fully local/no persistence" -> saves to catalog DB + search index; order detail "fulfilment actions not available" -> audited state machine; settings "saving performs no operation" -> versioned config store with revision history; audit log "nothing is a record of a real action" -> live audit entries; customers/orders "sample records" -> live database rows; roles "not enforced anywhere" -> enforced on every admin API request; WhatsApp integration "Prototype live" -> "Live".
- Truth preserved where genuinely true: users-view inline roster still flagged as placeholders (rows are hardcoded, not DB records); media view R2 caveat reworded to "local development mode" (upload POST landed by the orchestrator afterwards and copy flipped); misleading aria-label "(simulated)" fixed to accurate label.
- Sweep: post-edit grep over src/app/admin/**/*.tsx for prototype|mock|simulat|sample|fake|demo -> only neutral remnants remain (PrototypeNotice component name in src/components/**).
- Validation: bun run lint -> exit 0, 0 problems. Scope strictly limited to src/app/admin/**/*-view.tsx + admin/error.tsx.

Stage Summary:
- Every admin view now tells the operational truth: views that persist say so (products, settings, order transitions); views whose handlers were stubs or whose endpoints didn't exist said "not wired into this console yet" without mock/prototype language; genuinely-placeholder data (users roster) and local-mode media notes stay honestly caveated. Zero logic or structure changes; lint clean.

Task: Close the Cloudflare deployment gap — real wrangler.toml, Worker binding injection, adapter tooling, script documentation, stale-file removal.

Work Log:
- Audited readiness: wrangler config existed only as sketches (BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md §19.1 + CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md); no Worker-side path existed to populate globalThis.__VAPETIVE_D1__ / __VAPETIVE_MEDIA_R2__ / __VAPETIVE_KV__ (D1 client would silently fall back to non-persistent local SQLite on Workers).
- Removed stale tests/ folder (3 sandbox probes referencing the deleted Prisma db:push workflow and ../.zscripts harness — dead weight).
- Created wrangler.toml (root): OpenNext main (.open-next/worker.js), compatibility_flags [nodejs_compat, nodejs_compat_populate_process_env, global_fetch_strictly_public], [assets] binding ASSETS, D1 DB, R2 MEDIA, R2 NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET (ISR), KV SETTINGS, observability, APP_ENV=production; queues/DO/crons deliberately commented until consumer handlers ship (binding-without-handler fails wrangler deploy); one-time provisioning checklist in header.
- Created open-next.config.ts with r2IncrementalCache override (verified subpath resolves via the adapter's wildcard exports map in @opennextjs/cloudflare@1.20.12).
- Created src/server/bindings.ts: lazy idempotent injectWorkerBindings() — maps getCloudflareContext().env DB/MEDIA/SETTINGS onto the globalThis contract and mirrors string vars/secrets into process.env; caught no-op outside Workers.
- Wired injection into all three storage surfaces: db/client.ts getDb(), kv.ts binding(), admin media upload route.
- Installed devDeps wrangler@4.151.3 + @opennextjs/cloudflare@1.20.12 (peer warning on next@16.1.3 noted — first real cf:build must be validated on a deploy machine/CI; not runnable in sandbox as next build contends with the running dev server's .next).
- package.json: added db:migrate / db:migrate:remote / cf:build / cf:preview / cf:deploy / cf:typegen scripts.
- .gitignore: added /.wrangler/, /.open-next/, .dev.vars, worker-configuration.d.ts; created .dev.vars.example (APP_ENV=preview + secrets template).
- Rewrote docs/CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md as the real runbook: topology, binding table, secrets, provisioning commands, build/deploy, env matrix, post-deploy checklist.
- Diagnosed dev-server outage after install (stale module graph: "Module not found: @opennextjs/cloudflare" then process death); restart with fresh node_modules resolved it.
- VERIFY: eslint 0 / tsc --noEmit 0; home + /api/v1/catalog/products + /site/settings + /site/navigation + /search all 200; agent-browser: home title correct, zero page/console errors, /collections renders 32 data-driven cards.

Stage Summary:
- The ".toml gap" is closed with real, deploy-ready wiring: wrangler.toml + open-next.config.ts + src/server/bindings.ts match the code's structural binding contract exactly (D1/R2/KV), and the local SQLite fallback remains untouched for sandbox dev. Code-side Cloudflare deployment is complete; the only remaining pre-launch items are account-side provisioning (create D1/R2/KV, paste IDs, set secrets, db:migrate:remote, cf:preview → cf:deploy). Stale tests/ probes removed; all package.json scripts and scripts/ folder documented for the user.

Task ID: 27-b
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Verify robots.txt / sitemap.xml readiness and fix two production traps (build-time prerender).

Work Log:
- Verified src/app/robots.ts + src/app/sitemap.ts (Next.js Metadata routes, env-driven origin via NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL in src/lib/seo.tsx, mirrored by metadataBase in layout.tsx).
- Live check: /robots.txt serves correct rules (allow /, disallow /admin /cart /checkout /saved /account /categories /api/ + absolute Sitemap line); /sitemap.xml serves 74 URLs — 14 static + collections + brands + 43 live product URLs from D1 with real updated_at.
- TRAP 1 fixed: sitemap.ts would prerender at build time with an EMPTY catalog (no D1 during cf:build; .catch(()=>[]) masks it) — added export const dynamic = "force-dynamic" so the URL list is always computed at request time with real bindings.
- TRAP 2 fixed: prerendered pages + robots.txt bake the origin at BUILD time — added NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://vapetive.ae" to wrangler.toml [vars] and documented the build-time export requirement in docs/CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md §5 + post-deploy checklist.
- VERIFY: /robots.txt + /sitemap.xml 200 after hot reload (43 product URLs present); eslint 0.

Stage Summary:
- robots.txt + sitemap.xml are fully deploy-ready: code-based routes (no static files), live-catalog sitemap, env-driven origin, and the two build-time traps (empty-catalog prerender, localhost origin bake) are closed and documented in the deployment runbook.

Task ID: 27-c
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Diagnose and fix the failed Cloudflare Workers Builds deploy ("Could not find compiled Open Next config").

Work Log:
- Root cause chain confirmed from the CI log + adapter source: dashboard build command ran the old Node-standalone script (next build + cp); `npx wrangler deploy` detected open-next.config.ts and delegated to opennextjs-cloudflare deploy, which requires .open-next/.build/open-next.config.edge.mjs — produced only by `opennextjs-cloudflare build`. Artifacts never existed → exit 1.
- Verified in adapter source that .next/standalone output IS required by the OpenNext build (createServerBundle reads .next/standalone) — so output:"standalone" stays in next.config.ts.
- package.json: "build" repointed to `opennextjs-cloudflare build` (runs next build internally + generates .open-next) so the existing Workers Builds config (build `bun run build` / deploy `npx wrangler deploy`) works with ZERO dashboard changes; "start" made self-contained (copies static+public into standalone, then runs the server).
- Second latent trap fixed: the CI log showed robots.txt prerendered static with NO build-time NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL → it baked `Sitemap: http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml`. seo.tsx now exports SITE_ORIGIN (NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL ?? (NODE_ENV=production ? https://vapetive.ae : localhost:3000)); layout.tsx metadataBase uses SITE_ORIGIN — localhost can no longer leak into a production build.
- docs/CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md §5 rewritten: Workers Builds settings table, deploy-order warning (provision D1/KV + paste real IDs BEFORE first deploy — wrangler validates bindings and fails on placeholders), optional populate-cache warm step.
- VERIFY: eslint 0, tsc --noEmit 0, dev server 200, robots.txt dev fallback unchanged (localhost in dev), 0 errors in dev.log.

Stage Summary:
- Deploy failure root-caused and fixed at the source: the repo's `build` script now produces exactly what `wrangler deploy` (via OpenNext delegation) consumes. Remaining blocker for the user is account-side only: provision D1/R2/KV, paste real IDs into wrangler.toml, set SESSION_SIGNING_KEY (+optional Stripe/Resend/Turnstile) secrets, commit+push. CI build itself already proved the app compiles clean on Cloudflare infra (99 routes, TypeScript pass).

Task ID: 28
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Diagnose and fix the Cloudflare Workers Builds infinite build recursion (CI stuck printing "OpenNext — Cloudflare build" banner forever).

Work Log:
- Root-caused from the CI log pattern: `bun run build` → `opennextjs-cloudflare build` → adapter's "Building Next.js app" step → re-ran `bun run build` → banner again, looping ~every 3s until CI timeout.
- Read the installed adapter source to confirm the mechanism: @opennextjs/aws@4.1.11 `dist/build/buildNextApp.js` resolves the Next build command as `config.buildCommand ?? (\`${packager} run build\` for bun/npm)`; with bun.lock present the default is `bun run build` — which IS `opennextjs-cloudflare build` in our package.json → unguarded infinite recursion. Verified normalizeOptions passes the user config through, and that cloudflare `deploy` does not rebuild (chained build+deploy stays correct).
- Fix (open-next.config.ts): spread `defineCloudflareConfig(...)` and added top-level `buildCommand: "bun run build:next"` (documented OpenNextConfig escape hatch; adapter injects NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE=true so standalone output is still emitted).
- Fix (package.json): added dedicated `"build:next": "next build"` script; `build` stays `opennextjs-cloudflare build` so the existing Workers Builds dashboard config (build `bun run build` / deploy `npx wrangler deploy`) keeps working with zero dashboard changes.
- docs/CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md §5: new "Build-script recursion (do not regress)" warning block with the 3 naming rules.
- VERIFY: package.json parses (bun -e JSON check), `tsc --noEmit` exit 0 (config + buildCommand type-valid). Full build intentionally NOT run in sandbox (forbidden + would clobber dev .next).

Stage Summary:
- CI hang root-caused to a missing-recursion-guard default in @opennextjs/aws when `scripts.build` is the OpenNext command under bun/npm. Closed via `buildCommand` override in open-next.config.ts + `build:next` script. After push, Workers Builds should proceed past "Building Next.js app" to "Generating bundle" → wrangler deploy.

---
Task ID: 29
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Fix second Cloudflare CI failure — esbuild "Could not resolve bun:sqlite" during OpenNext "Generating bundle" (after the Task 28 recursion fix got the build to the bundle stage).

Work Log:
- Confirmed Task 28 fix works in CI: log shows `$ next build` ran ONCE (no recursion), 99 routes compiled, build reached "Generating bundle".
- Root cause of new failure: src/server/db/local.ts used `const spec = "bun:sqlite"; await import(spec)` with webpackIgnore/turbopackIgnore comments; Turbopack const-folded the variable into a LITERAL dynamic import and emitted `import("bun:sqlite")` into 4 server chunks; OpenNext's esbuild step (runs under Node, targets workerd) cannot resolve the bun-only builtin → 4 errors, build exit 1.
- Trapped between bundlers: literal specifier → esbuild fails; variable specifier → Turbopack hard-fails next build with "Module not found" (verified locally). Checked OpenNext bundle-server.js: esbuild `external` list is hardcoded, no config surface to add externals.
- Fix (src/server/db/local.ts): sqlite modules now loaded via `process.getBuiltinModule()` — plain runtime API, generates NO import() expression, invisible to Turbopack AND esbuild; resolved by the real runtime only when the local fallback executes. Verified Bun 1.4 returns Database for bun:sqlite and undefined for node:sqlite. Clear error if runtime lacks getBuiltinModule (Bun>=1.1/Node>=22.3 required).
- Defense in depth (src/server/db/client.ts): local.ts is now lazily imported only when the D1 binding is absent — the local driver (node:fs + getBuiltinModule paths) never evaluates on the Worker boot path; type-only LocalDb import kept.
- open-next.config.ts: named the exported config object (fixes import/no-anonymous-default-export warning).
- docs/CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md §5: new "Server-bundle purity" warning block documenting both bundler traps + reference implementation.
- VERIFY: tsc --noEmit 0; eslint 0 errors/0 warnings; FULL local `bun run cf:build` (identical to CI command) passes end-to-end: next build 99 routes → esbuild bundle → "Worker saved in .open-next/worker.js" → "OpenNext build complete."; grep of .open-next/worker.js shows 0 occurrences of bun:sqlite / sqlite import(); dev server restarted, / 200 and /api/v1/site/settings 200 (exercises the new loader against db/vapetive.db at runtime).

Stage Summary:
- The Cloudflare CI build pipeline is now verified green through artifact generation locally, with both failure modes (Task 28 recursion + Task 29 bun:sqlite esbuild resolution) fixed at source and documented. On push, Workers Builds should complete the build and hand off to `npx wrangler deploy`; the only remaining deploy blockers are account-side (provision D1/R2/KV, paste real IDs into wrangler.toml, set SESSION_SIGNING_KEY etc.) per runbook §4/§7.

Task: Provide working admin credentials (user asked for admin login).

Work Log:
- Found credentials in scripts/seed.ts (defaults overridable via ADMIN_EMAIL / ADMIN_PASSWORD env).
- Inspected db/vapetive.db: tables auto-migrated but EMPTY (0 users/products) — seed had never been applied to the current DB.
- Ran `bun run db:seed`: seeded 43 products, 12 brands, 5 categories, 18 media, 5 users, 3 demo orders, 5 tickets, 22 FAQs, 4 legal pages.
- E2E verify: POST /api/v1/auth/sign-in with seeded admin -> 200 isStaff:true; GET /admin with session cookie -> 200 (RBAC gate passes).

Stage Summary:
- Local dev DB is now fully seeded. Admin sign-in: admin@vapetive.example / Admin#Vapetive2025 (super-admin role). These are DEV DEFAULTS — production D1 needs its own seed (runbook §5) and the password must be rotated via ADMIN_* env vars at seed time or changed post-login.

---
Task ID: 31
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Cloudflare seed data for products + everything else (user asked what happens to seed data on Cloudflare).

Work Log:
- Confirmed gap: scripts/seed.ts only writes the local SQLite file (db/vapetive.db); a fresh D1 boots empty. Runbook §5 had "follow-up tooling" placeholder for exactly this.
- Read src/server/kv.ts + repos/settings.ts: on Workers the settings repo reads the KV BINDING with NO D1 fallback → settings:site/delivery/features must go to Workers KV, SQL alone is insufficient.
- Built scripts/export-d1-seed.ts: dumps the seeded local DB to scripts/seed-d1.sql (33 tables, 889 rows; skips sqlite internals, FTS5 virtual+shadow tables, _migrations, ephemeral runtime tables: sessions/carts/job_queue/tokens/idempotency_keys; FK-topologically sorted DELETE-then-INSERT inside one transaction with PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys; multi-row INSERT chunks ≤48KB/40 rows under D1's 100KB statement cap) + scripts/seed-kv/{manifest.json,<key>.json} (verbatim KV values).
- Built scripts/kv-remote.ts: applies seed-kv via `wrangler kv key put --binding SETTINGS` (--remote for prod, --local for parity tests).
- package.json: db:seed:export / db:seed:remote (wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --file) / db:seed:kv:remote.
- Fixed two TS errors during build: never-narrowing in sqlValue default branch (cast for constructor name); Bun global untyped in kv-remote (switched to node:child_process spawnSync).
- E2E VERIFIED against fresh miniflare D1 (same engine as prod): rm -rf .wrangler/state → db:migrate (2 migrations) → wrangler d1 execute DB --local --file scripts/seed-d1.sql → all success; counts 43 products/12 brands/80 images/5 users/3 orders/5 tickets/18 media/25 nav/22 faqs; fts_rows 43 = fts_idx 43 (triggers repopulated external-content FTS5 index); pragma_foreign_key_check = 0 violations; FTS MATCH 'vape' = 34 hits in BOTH D1 and local file DB (parity). kv-remote --local applied 3 keys; settings:site read back verbatim. Full flow re-run from scratch = reproducible.
- Docs: wrangler.toml header provisioning list + runbook §4 (new "Seed data (D1 + KV)" section incl. reset-warning, gitignored-artifacts note, admin credentials section) + §7 checklist; .gitignore += /scripts/seed-d1.sql + /scripts/seed-kv/ (embed admin password hash).
- VERIFY: tsc --noEmit 0; scoped eslint on new scripts 0 (full-repo lint OOM-killed only because dev server holds 1.4GB; src/ untouched this task).

Stage Summary:
- Cloudflare seed tooling is shipped and verified: `bun run db:seed:export` (on the seeded local DB) → `bun run db:seed:remote` (D1) → `bun run db:seed:kv:remote` (Workers KV). Combined with db:migrate:remote, a fresh production D1 + KV gets the full demo store: 43 products with images/variants/specs/FTS, navigation, legal, FAQs, RBAC + super-admin, demo orders/tickets/audit, and site settings. Seed artifacts are generated + gitignored (contain password hash). Admin credentials on Cloudflare = local seed credentials (ADMIN_EMAIL/ADMIN_PASSWORD defaults admin@vapetive.example / Admin#Vapetive2025) until rotated.

Task ID: 32
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Fix remote D1 seed failure ("please use state.storage.transaction() instead of SQL BEGIN TRANSACTION") + answer where SESSION_SIGNING_KEY comes from (user's first Cloudflare deploy attempt).

Work Log:
- User's remote apply failed: production D1 rejects explicit BEGIN/COMMIT/SAVEPOINT in `wrangler d1 execute --file`; miniflare --local (my Task 31 verification surface) accepts them — validation gap, not a logic error. FK correctness never depended on the transaction (delete children→parents, insert parents→children ordering already guarantees constraint satisfaction per statement).
- scripts/export-d1-seed.ts: removed PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys + BEGIN TRANSACTION + COMMIT; documented why in header + dump preamble comments.
- Re-verified full flow on fresh miniflare D1: migrate (2 migrations) → seed file apply → 80/80 statements success, products 43 / users 5 / orders 3 / fts_idx 43 / pragma_foreign_key_check 0 violations. tsc 0; scoped eslint 0.
- Runbook §4: two new warning blocks — "no BEGIN/COMMIT/SAVEPOINT (remote-only restriction, miniflare more lenient)" and "0 rows, 0 tables = local DB was never seeded; run db:seed first (user hit exactly this: db/ is gitignored, fresh clone has empty auto-migrated DB)".
- SESSION_SIGNING_KEY (answered to user): not downloaded — self-generated random secret (≥32 bytes) used by src/server/env.ts to sign session cookies (HMAC); production refuses to boot without it. Generation: bun -e / node -e / openssl rand. wrangler secret put on a not-yet-deployed worker prompts to create a placeholder worker → answer yes (secrets survive subsequent deploys from CI).

Stage Summary:
- Remote seed dump is now compatible with production D1 (order-based, no explicit transactions) and re-verified green locally. User's deploy path unblocked: bun run db:seed → db:seed:export → db:seed:remote → db:seed:kv:remote; create-worker prompt at `wrangler secret put` should be answered yes.

Task ID: 33
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: User hit "Wrangler requires at least Node.js v22.0.0. You are using v20.18.0" on `bun run db:seed:remote` (Windows machine, Node 20).

Work Log:
- Diagnosis: `bun run` resolves the local wrangler bin (shebang → system Node 20.18.0) and wrangler ≥4.150 enforces Node ≥22. The user's earlier `bunx wrangler` commands worked because bunx executes bins under the Bun runtime (no Node version check).
- package.json: switched Node-optional wrangler invocations to bunx — db:seed:remote, db:migrate, db:migrate:remote, cf:typegen (bunx prefers node_modules/.bin after bun install, so the pinned 4.151.x wins over stale global cache like the 4.86.0 the user saw). db:seed:kv:remote already spawned bunx internally. `build`/`cf:build`/`cf:preview`/`cf:deploy` deliberately UNCHANGED — CI-verified path (Workers Builds has Node 22).
- Re-verified on fresh miniflare D1 with the new scripts: bun run db:migrate (2 migrations ✓) → db:seed:export (889 rows, 33 tables) → seed file 80/80 statements ✓ → products 43 / fts_idx 43 / fk_violations 0.
- Runbook §5 CLI: new note — wrangler ≥4.150 needs Node ≥22; bunx-wrangler pattern for older Node; bun install first if bunx resolves stale cached wrangler.

Stage Summary:
- All db:* provisioning scripts now run on any machine with Bun regardless of Node version (Windows user's Node 20 unblocked). Durable recommendation remains installing Node 22 LTS. CI unaffected.

Task ID: 34
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: User's deployed worker (vapetive.demo-web.workers.dev) 500s on ALL API routes (settings/products/categories/session) while static pages serve fine.

Work Log:
- Probed live: / 200, /robots.txt 200 (ASSETS binding, no worker execution), API routes 500 with plain-text "Internal Server Error" (NOT the app's JSON error envelope) → worker throws before route handlers → boot-path failure.
- Traced boot path: src/server/env.ts:21-23 module-scope guard — `if (IS_PROD && !process.env.SESSION_SIGNING_KEY) throw`. wrangler.toml sets APP_ENV=production; env.ts is statically imported by every server chunk (db/client.ts etc.) → one missing secret = isolate-level throw = every dynamic route 500. Static assets bypass the worker script entirely. Symptoms match 1:1.
- Verified binding wiring is sound (bindings.ts lazily maps getCloudflareContext().env DB/MEDIA/SETTINGS onto globalThis + mirrors string secrets into process.env; nodejs_compat_populate_process_env flag populates process.env synchronously at boot incl. secrets) → once the secret exists, boot passes and D1/KV paths activate.
- Root cause is account-side config (missing secret), as designed + documented (runbook §3/§7); no code change needed. Logged diagnosis + fix path for user.

Stage Summary:
- Fix: `bunx wrangler secret put SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` (takes effect immediately, no redeploy). Then complete data layer: db:migrate:remote → db:seed:remote → db:seed:kv:remote. Console preload warnings about smoke PNGs are benign (Next image preload credentials-mode mismatch — cosmetic, can address separately).

---
Task ID: 35
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: User completed `bunx wrangler secret put SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` — confirm placement + lay out remaining deploy steps.

Work Log:
- User output: wrangler prompted "no Worker called vapetive-web → create?" (answered yes) and uploaded the secret. Expected behavior (documented in Task 32): secret put on a not-yet-deployed worker creates a placeholder; secrets survive all subsequent deploys.
- Verified placement correctness: wrangler.toml (committed HEAD) `name = "vapetive-web"` — secret is on the exact worker the config deploys to. Placeholder worker currently has NO script → a real deploy is still required for traffic to serve from that name (explains why the earlier 500-ing worker resolved under a different name).
- Re-checked src/server/env.ts boot guard: SESSION_SIGNING_KEY is the ONLY boot-required secret; Stripe/Resend/Turnstile degrade gracefully when absent (feature-optional).
- Confirmed script inventory for next steps: db:migrate:remote / db:seed / db:seed:export / db:seed:remote / db:seed:kv:remote / cf:deploy; runbook §7 post-deploy checklist remains the verification surface.

Stage Summary:
- SESSION_SIGNING_KEY confirmed on vapetive-web (correct). Remaining sequence: remote data layer (migrate → seed export → seed D1 → seed KV) → real deploy to vapetive-web (cf:deploy or CI) → §7 verification (API 200s, robots/sitemap origin, admin sign-in + rotate). Old differently-named worker from the first deploy attempt is now stale.

---
Task ID: 36
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: User's remote data layer completed — verify state and identify the single remaining gap (worker script not yet deployed).

Work Log:
- User terminal: D1 seed SUCCESS (80/80 queries, 2740 rows written, 0.95 MB, real database_id cd327431-…) → proves remote migrations were already applied (seed emits no DDL; first DELETE would fail on missing tables otherwise). KV seed SUCCESS (settings:site/delivery/features → namespace a7b5ceda…). Git push 21c6d9b (package.json bunx script fix from Task 33) to github.com/mycampushub/vapetive.
- Then re-ran `bunx wrangler secret put SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` and wrangler AGAIN prompted "Creating new Worker vapetive-web" → as of that moment NO script was deployed to vapetive-web, despite the push happening BEFORE the secret put. Conclusion: Workers Builds CI either not connected, not configured, or the build hadn't completed. Data layer is done; the app script is the only missing piece.
- Node-20 deploy fallback reasoned out: cf:deploy (opennextjs-cloudflare deploy) may spawn wrangler under system Node 20 → Node-22 check. Fallback two-step: `bunx opennextjs-cloudflare build` + `bunx wrangler deploy` (bunx executes bins under Bun runtime — user's bunx wrangler calls demonstrably work on Node 20).

Stage Summary:
- Production data layer COMPLETE: D1 migrated + seeded (43 products, RBAC, orders, FTS), KV settings live, SESSION_SIGNING_KEY secret on vapetive-web. Remaining: deploy the worker script (CI green or bunx opennextjs-cloudflare build + bunx wrangler deploy), then runbook §7 verification (API 200s, products visible, admin sign-in + rotate, robots/sitemap origin via NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL build var).

Task ID: 37
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: User shared live URL https://vapetive.demo-web.workers.dev/ for testing — probe it, diagnose the API 500s, and align the worker name.

Work Log:
- Live probes: / -> 200 (1.55s, cf-ray HKG); /api/v1/site/settings -> 500 plain-text "Internal Server Error" (NOT the app's JSON envelope = pre-route boot throw); /api/v1/catalog/products -> 500 same; /robots.txt -> 200 with correct vapetive.ae origin.
- Discriminating probe: https://vapetive-web.demo-web.workers.dev/ -> 404 "error code: 1042" (worker not found) -> proves the "vapetive-web" worker still has NO script (only the secret from the placeholder creation), and the URL the user shared serves a DIFFERENT, older worker named "vapetive" (from the very first deploy) that never received the secret.
- Root cause: SESSION_SIGNING_KEY lives on "vapetive-web"; live worker "vapetive" lacks it -> env.ts boot guard throws -> every dynamic route 500s while static/asset routes serve. Git archaeology: repo wrangler.toml has ALWAYS been "vapetive-web" (single +name in history) — the first deploy came from a divergent local config.
- Fix decision (lowest friction): canonicalize on "vapetive" — it already serves traffic and gets the instant no-redeploy fix: `bunx wrangler secret put SESSION_SIGNING_KEY --name vapetive` (secret put on a deployed worker rolls a new version immediately).
- Repo aligned: wrangler.toml name -> "vapetive" (+ canonical-name comment with live URL); docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md diagram + JSON snippet -> "vapetive". Runbook had no name references.
- Cleanup path: after verification, delete placeholder `bunx wrangler delete --name vapetive-web` (holds only a secret). Next deploys from repo/CI now land on the live worker.

Stage Summary:
- Diagnosis complete: live worker "vapetive" = old script, no secret (API 500s); "vapetive-web" = empty placeholder. User action: put the secret on "vapetive" (--name flag) for an instant fix, pull the repo rename for future deploys. Data layer (D1 + KV) is already seeded and binding-correct, so APIs should go fully green the moment the secret lands.

Task ID: 38
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Investigate user report "some data showing, some not" on live https://vapetive.demo-web.workers.dev — detail pages, products, content.

Work Log:
- Full live sweep after secret fix: ALL APIs 200 (settings KV, navigation, products 43 total paginated 9/page max 48, categories 5, brands 12, faqs 22, legal 4, FTS search works). Agent Browser verified rendered pages: category grid (31 products, images, AED pricing, badges), PDP (gallery, variants, save-AED badge), legal pages, brands — all correct. Earlier "aura-700 no image" scare = parser artifact (commas in quoted SQL strings); ground truth via bun:sqlite: 43/43 products have images, all files deployed.
- BUG 1 (root-caused): /help/faq renders "SHOWING 0 OF 0 QUESTIONS" — page is statically prerendered (no dynamic export) so it baked the BUILD machine's DB content; CI/fresh clones have empty auto-migrated db/vapetive.db (db/ gitignored) → empty FAQ baked into immutable HTML. Same risk class for 4 legal pages.
- FIX 1: added `export const revalidate = 3600` to faq + 4 legal pages (ISR self-heal from D1 within 1h via R2 NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET); runbook §5 new warning block "Static prerenders bake the BUILD machine's database"; CI build command row → `bun install && bun run db:seed && bun run build`. Durable user fix: deploy from a seeded machine.
- BUG 2: one-off transient 404 on /legal/terms in browser (200 via curl minutes later) — transient D1 read during render; revalidate addition lets it self-heal.
- BUG 3 (found during audit): admin media POST on Workers returned `/cdn-cgi/media/...` URLs served by NOTHING (and /cdn-cgi is Cloudflare-reserved) → uploaded images would 404. FIX: new public route src/app/api/v1/media/[...key]/route.ts (R2 get on Workers, public/uploads fallback locally, immutable cache, traversal-guarded); upload URL shape → `/api/v1/media/<folder>/<fileName>`, r2Key = `<folder>/<fileName>` (no prod R2 data yet → free rename); MediaR2Like extended with optional get().
- Verified: tsc 0; scoped eslint 0; local media route 404-JSON (no R2) + 200 image/jpeg with immutable cache-control on seeded probe file; faq page + API still green on dev server.

Stage Summary:
- Site content verified largely healthy live; two real defects fixed (stale-DB prerender trap + dead media URL). User must redeploy from their seeded machine (or adopt the new CI build command) to bake FAQ/legal with data and ship fixes; then re-verify /help/faq shows 22 questions.

Task: User reports header/footer menu items + home products/brands/collections sections missing on live; asked for comprehensive live+repo investigation.

Work Log:
- Cloned github.com/mycampushub/vapetive (HEAD bdc9c7e). Drift audit vs sandbox: repo is missing ALL Task 35-38 fixes (wrangler name rename, revalidate exports, media route, docs/ folder entirely absent — user never had the runbook). Repo has user's own compatibility_date bump (2026-06-15) — adopted in sandbox. package.json fully synced.
- Live browser evidence: home header has NO menu links (4 = logo/search/icons/account only), footer reduced to 6 links; category/PDP pages show full nav. Bogus PDP /products/aura-700 still HTTP 200 soft-404 → OLD build still deployed.
- Root cause (complete chain): AppShell is an async server component fetching headerNav/mobileNav/footerColumns/legalNav from D1; the deployed old build predates the Task-26 maintenance check (layout now calls cookies() → whole (site) segment renders dynamically). Old layout was static → ALL public pages prerendered at build time on a machine with an EMPTY db/vapetive.db (db/ gitignored, db:seed never run before that build) → nav, footer columns, mobile nav, home products/brands/collections sections, FAQ, legal bodies all baked EMPTY. Dynamic pages re-render per request → data + nav present. D1/KV data itself verified complete (43 products, 12 brands, 5 categories, 22 faqs, nav rows).
- Structural fix already in code: current layout's cookies() forces dynamic rendering → nav/footer/home sections render live from D1 on next deploy; per-page revalidate=3600 (faq/legal) + runbook CI seed command as belt-and-braces.
- wrangler.toml: adopted compatibility_date 2026-06-15 (kept user's bump + my name=vapetive rename).
- Generated DEPLOY-FIXES.patch (14 files: 6 docs + faq/legal revalidate + media GET route + admin media URL shape + env.ts + wrangler.toml) — verified `git apply --check` clean against repo HEAD bdc9c7e. tsc 0.

Stage Summary:
- Everything the user sees missing = one root cause: deployed build prerendered from an empty database; the running code is stale (missing all sandbox fixes). Delivery vehicle created: DEPLOY-FIXES.patch (apply on repo HEAD → sync local → deploy from seeded machine with name=vapetive so the real worker gets the code). After deploy: nav/footer/home sections render dynamically, FAQ shows 22, bogus PDPs return 404, admin uploads get working URLs.

Task ID: 40
Agent: main (orchestrator)
Task: Apply ALL fixes in the sandbox project so the user can download it and redeploy; final verification pass.

Work Log:
- Confirmed every prior fix is present in this copy: wrangler.toml name=vapetive + compat 2026-06-15, revalidate=3600 on faq + 4 legal pages, public /api/v1/media/[...key] GET route, admin upload URL /api/v1/media/<folder>/<fileName>, env.ts MediaR2Like.get, docs/ runbook with CI seed command.
- NEW BUG found & fixed (was visible live as "bogus PDP returns 200"): soft-404s. /products|collections|brand/[slug] for missing slugs returned HTTP 200 — any loading.tsx Suspense boundary above the page lets the shell flush 200 before notFound() streams, and Next 15.2+ streams generateMetadata too (notFound() there did NOT fix the status).
- Empirical proof: removing boundaries → real 404s; restoring (site)/loading.tsx alone → 200 again.
- FIX: deleted the 4 softening boundaries — (site)/loading.tsx, products/[slug]/loading.tsx, collections/[slug]/loading.tsx, brand/[slug]/loading.tsx; kept discover/search skeletons (list pages, never notFound) and all admin skeletons (auth-gated, no SEO impact). notFound() now also called in generateMetadata of the 3 detail pages (belt-and-braces + correct metadata).
- Verified: bogus slugs /products/aura-700, /products|collections|brand/does-not-exist → 404 with branded "Lost in the haze" page; real PDP /products/al-fakher-crown-bar-pro-8000 → 200 (AED 65, gallery); homepage header menu (Discover/Collections/Brands/Help) + footer (22 links, 3 column groups) + 16 product cards + 12 brand cards + 5 collection links all render from D1; page/API sweep all 200 (account 307 → sign-in, expected); tsc 0; scoped eslint 0.
- Removed obsolete DEPLOY-FIXES.patch (project itself is now the delivery vehicle). Added runbook §0 "Download & redeploy — quick start" with the 4-command sequence + Node-20 fallback + post-deploy checklist.
- Note: dev server was OOM-killed by a full-repo eslint run once (restart fixed); use scoped eslint.

Stage Summary:
- Project is download-ready with ALL fixes applied: nav/footer/home sections render dynamically from D1, FAQ/legal ISR self-heal, media uploads servable, bogus URLs return real 404s. User flow: download → bun install → db:migrate + db:seed → NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://vapetive.ae bun run cf:deploy (or bunx two-step on Node 20). Secret/D1/KV already live on the vapetive worker — deploy only ships code.
