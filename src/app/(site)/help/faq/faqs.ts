    id: "brands-stocked",
    category: "Devices",
    question: "Which brands does VAPETIVE stock?",
    answer:
      "The catalog currently stocks one focused line: IQOS ILUMA heat-not-burn tobacco sticks. The range spans the multi-origin duty-free line (Amber, Silver, Yellow, the Wave and Pearl editions), the Indonesia line (Sienna, Bronze, the Dimension Series and more) and the Japan line (Black Menthol, the Regular family and more). Every listing shows its flavour profile, sticks per pack and origin line, and is authenticity-checked before it goes on the wall.",
  },
  {
    id: "device-setup",
    category: "Devices",
    question: "Do the sticks need a special device?",
    answer:
      "Yes — these tobacco sticks are prepared exclusively for the IQOS ILUMA system and are not compatible with older IQOS models. The device itself is not sold here; you need a charged ILUMA holder. Insert the stick until it stops, start the heating cycle as usual and draw gently. Full usage steps are in the manual that came with your device.",
  },
  {
    id: "devices-rechargeable",
    category: "Devices",
    question: "Do the sticks contain a battery?",
    answer:
      "No. Every stick is just prepared tobacco — all heating and electronics live in the IQOS ILUMA holder, which charges over USB-C. The holder's battery details are in its own manual; each stick is used once and then disposed of responsibly.",
  },
  {
    id: "coils-pods",
    category: "Devices",
    question: "Are the sticks compatible with every IQOS device?",
    answer:
      "No — they are made for the IQOS ILUMA family only and will not work correctly with older-blade IQOS models. Check the Compatibility line on each product page, and if in doubt WhatsApp us the model printed on your holder before ordering.",
  },
  {
    id: "travel-device",
    category: "Devices",
    question: "Can I travel with my device?",
    answer:
      "Airline rules vary by carrier and destination, so always check your airline's policy before flying. As a general baseline: carry devices and liquids in cabin baggage, never in the hold; keep spare batteries away from metal objects; and confirm that vapor products are legal where you are going. Use is prohibited on board at all times.",
  },
  {
    id: "verify-authenticity",
    category: "Devices",
    question: "How does VAPETIVE verify authenticity?",
    answer:
      "We source through vetted official distribution channels, and every brand we stock ships with its own security feature — a scratch panel or QR code on the packaging. Our Dubai team checks stock against those marks before listing it. If you want to double-check a product you bought from us, WhatsApp us the code on the panel and we will verify it against our records.",
  },
  /* ------------------------------- Sticks ------------------------------- */
  {
    id: "store-liquids",
    category: "Sticks",
    question: "How should I store the tobacco sticks?",
    answer:
      "Keep the pack sealed, upright, out of direct sunlight and below 25 °C — and always out of reach of children and pets. Stored this way, sticks are best enjoyed before the date printed on the pack.",
  },
  {
    id: "nicotine-strengths",
    category: "Sticks",
    question: "Do the sticks contain nicotine?",
    answer:
      "Yes — these are real tobacco products and they contain nicotine, which is addictive. Heat-not-burn delivers nicotine differently from cigarettes or e-liquids: the tobacco is heated, never burned. Nicotine information is printed on every pack and each product page carries the flavour profile and product details.",
  },
  {
    id: "salt-vs-freebase",
    category: "Sticks",
    question: "How is heat-not-burn different from vaping?",
    answer:
      "Vaping aerosolises a liquid; heat-not-burn heats a real tobacco stick just enough to release a tobacco-flavoured aerosol — no burning, no ash and no lighter. That is why the sticks only work in a compatible induction device such as the IQOS ILUMA. The product pages describe each flavour profile so you can pick the tobacco, menthol or capsule edition that suits you.",
  },
  /* ------------------------------- Safety ------------------------------ */
  {
    id: "legal-age",
    category: "Safety",
    question: "What is the legal age to purchase nicotine products?",
    answer:
      "Eighteen. It is illegal to sell nicotine products to anyone under 18 in the United Arab Emirates, and age verification is applied at purchase and again at delivery.",
  },
  {
    id: "liquid-skin-contact",
    category: "Safety",
    question: "What safety rules apply to the sticks?",
    answer:
      "The sticks are for adult nicotine users only — keep them sealed and away from children and pets, and never eat or swallow one; seek medical advice immediately if that happens. Do not use a damaged or damp stick, and let a used stick cool before disposing of it in general waste.",
  },
  {
    id: "dispose-device",
    category: "Safety",
    question: "How do I dispose of used sticks and the holder?",
    answer:
      "Let used sticks cool completely, then place them in general waste where local rules allow. The ILUMA holder itself contains a rechargeable cell — never bin it; take it to a battery collection point, which most supermarkets and electronics retailers in the UAE provide.",
  },
  /* ------------------------------- Orders ------------------------------ */
  {
    id: "how-ordering-works",
    category: "Orders",
    question: "How do I order from VAPETIVE?",
    answer:
      "Two ways. Add products to your bag and check out on the site with your delivery details, or send your list straight to our WhatsApp and a member of the Dubai team will confirm stock, total and delivery with you. Either route ends with the same courier handover — age-checked at your door.",
  },
  {
    id: "change-order",
    category: "Orders",
    question: "Can I change or cancel my order?",
    answer:
      "Orders can be changed or cancelled until they reach the packed stage; after that, refuse the delivery at the door or contact support to arrange a return.",
  },
  {
    id: "delivery-time",
    category: "Orders",
    question: "How long does delivery take?",
    answer:
      "Standard delivery completes within two to four business days anywhere in the UAE, and express next-day delivery is available where coverage allows. A valid Emirates ID check is completed at the door, as required for nicotine products.",
  },
  {
    id: "delivery-fees",
    category: "Orders",
    question: "What does delivery cost?",
    answer:
      "Standard delivery is free on orders of AED 200 or more and AED 25 below that, across all seven Emirates. Express next-day delivery — where available — is AED 35. The cart and checkout show the exact fee for your order before you confirm.",
  },
  {
    id: "payment-methods",
    category: "Orders",
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer:
      "Cash on delivery and card on delivery — you pay the courier at the door, in cash or on the courier's machine. No online card charge happens today.",
  },
  {
    id: "returns-faulty",
    category: "Orders",
    question: "What if a pack arrives faulty?",
    answer:
      "Contact support within seven days with your order reference and a photo or short video of the fault. We replace verified faulty packs or refund the order — the details are set out in our Terms of Sale. For hygiene reasons, opened packs can only be returned when the fault is confirmed.",
  },
  /* ------------------------------- Account ----------------------------- */
  {
    id: "reset-password",
    category: "Account",
    question: "How do I reset my password?",
    answer:
      "Choose Forgot password on the sign-in screen, enter your email and follow the secure link we send. Reset links expire for security — request a fresh one if yours has timed out.",
  },
  {
    id: "delete-saved-items",
    category: "Account",
    question: "How do I remove a saved product?",
    answer:
      "Open Saved in your account and deselect the bookmark on the product's card. Saved items sync to your account when you're signed in.",
  },

    question: "How do I request a copy of my data?",
    answer:
