/**
 * Public-site layout — wraps every public page (including account)
 * with the AppShell: gradient backdrop, ambient smoke, header,
 * sticky footer and mobile bottom navigation. The AppBootstrap provider
 * hydrates the client stores (auth, server cart, saved items, site
 * config) once per page load.
 *
 * Maintenance enforcement (QA audit Task 26): when the admin-toggled
 * `features.maintenance` flag is on, non-staff visitors get the offline
 * notice instead of storefront pages. Staff keep full access, and the
 * admin console lives outside this layout so it always stays reachable.
 *
 * Render the ENTIRE public site dynamically (per request).
 *
 * Why: header nav, footer columns, homepage sections, FAQ and legal bodies
 * all read D1/KV. If this segment were statically prerendered, pages would
 * bake whatever database the BUILD machine happened to have — a CI runner's
 * auto-migrated empty db/vapetive.db produces the exact "menu items and
 * homepage products/brands/collections missing" defect seen in production,
 * and even a seeded build freezes content until the next deploy (products
 * added from the admin console would never appear). Dynamic rendering makes
 * the build machine's DB state irrelevant and admin edits visible instantly;
 * on Workers the D1/KV reads are co-located and sub-millisecond.
