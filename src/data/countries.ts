 * Suggestion source for the admin product "Origins" editor (datalist).
 * Free-text is still accepted — the list only accelerates typing and keeps

 *
 * Active markets (2026-10): Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Indonesia,
 * Japan. To add a country later, append its display name to the array below
 * and deploy — this is a pure code change: no D1 migration, no database
 * touch, existing product data is never affected.
